Initially created a Computer class, Person class and Game class, as computer class was only creating a random selection, instead created a method withing the Game class.  
Started the challenge by creating a diogram of what will be responsible for what action and how will the website operate and what page will redirect to where.
Visulised how the website will be opearating and what page will be responsible for what. Decided on creating 3 pages that will be responsible for greeting, letting select a move and showing a result.
