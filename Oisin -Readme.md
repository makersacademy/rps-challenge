So, I accidentally started working on the non-apprenticeship version of this challenge. As a result, I had to change multiple things with the Spec_helper.rb file, as this was preventing my tests from working at all.

This cost me a lot of time, so I only partially got through user story one. You can see my approach in the 'plan.md' file.
