As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

Well “play” rock paper scissors is broad. How can we break this down?

1. I would like to initiate a game of rock paper scissors
2. I would like to choose my weapon
3. I would like to find out the result
4. I would like to play again
5. I would like to see the tally of scores
6. I would like some entertaining imagery

To improve:
- Add screanshot to readme
- Stub randomness - done
- If else statements for result - done (of sorts)
- Remove global variable
  - Create a game class
  - Store Class data 
- Weapons stored as constant - done
- Conditional gifs - done (of sorts)

To discuss with coach
- Testing initiate which does not have text (can I work this out? probably)
- The rubric didn't like my if else statement in my winner class. The rubric also missed out a draw option... who is right?
- My Tally test in result_spec sometimes fails when I had wins: 2. I assume this is because spec files are not always executed in the same order. What is the best way to test this?
- Stubbing randomness:
    allow_any_instance_of(Array).to receive(:sample).and_return('Scissors')
  seems very general, can affect other tests
- Calling business logic from the view
  I have conditional gifs, is this allowable? it feels odd to store gifs in the business logic
