ABOUT:		

This is a project/challenge set by the coding bootcamp Makers Academy and then completed by the AUTHOR as a learning assignment.

Consequently, all scripts not included in the 'app', 'lib' or 'spec' directory are the work of the staff at Makers Academy.
This README therefore only relates to these three directories.

The challenge is to build a simple online Rock Paper Scissors game that you can play against the computer from a locally hosted webpage.
