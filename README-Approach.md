Approach to solving challenge
======

- Use user stories to write the first set of feature tests (which should fail). 
- Write a series of unit tests based on the client's requirements to ensure that all feature tests pass. 
- Refactor the code and ensure it conforms to the Travis style guide and SRP. 
- Submit a pull request. 

Notes
- Was able to write the basic program, but have some errors that I'm struggling to solve.
- Will revisit these and/or ask a coach for help.
