As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

Scenario: A user can register their name
So once I am on the home page I can see "Please enter your name:"
Once I enter my name - I click submit and should see my name with three options to click from. 
After an option is picked, I should see the result of the game.
