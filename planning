As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
the marketeer can choose one option
the game will choose a random option
a winner will be declared

UI IRB

>> game = Game.new Player, GameHandler
  >> creates Player1 and Player2 >> give each other an opponent
>> game.player_1.take_turn :Rock
>> game.player_2.take_turn :Paper
    >> def process_result :Rock
>> game.check_winner?


Plan
>> map-out objects system
  >> Game
    Responsibilities >> store 2 players, produce a winner, run the game logic
    Attributes >> no attributes
    Actions >> check if winner, initialize 2 players, receive a turn
    Interactions >> player

  >> Player
    Responsibilities >> take a turn
    Attributes >> winnner, loser
    Actions >>
    Interactions >>

  >> GameHandler?

>> map-out route Sinatra (MVP) >> add Player 2 route for multi-player
  >> get a home page that takes to a link
  >> get a form which takes your name
  >> post result which shows that your name is Alex
  >> get a form (game/turn) where ask for rock, paper or scissors
  >> post a result
  >> continue posting result until redirect to a winner page


Plan - left to-do
>> Full cucumber test coverage
>> Fix underlying rspec test
>> Need to go for third time to complete end of game
>> Add styling/ CSS across so can share
>> Complete additional rules (if time and useful)
>> Refactor system code
>> Add complete README
