"Fear is a reflex. Courage is a choice",
"There is no spoon",
"All these moments will be lost in time, like teardrops in rain",
"No impression, cleave the centre",
"What we do in life, echoes in eternity",
"Ultimately, we're all dead men. Sadly, we cannot choose how but, what we can decide is how we meet that end, in order that we are remembered as men",
"Fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind",
"If you have to die, die furious",
"Find the line and cross it",
"If life gives you lemons, demand strawberries"
