Goals of each class
* Tried to separate out single responsibilities, so the computer class is randomly sampling from an array; the game class is defining win, lose or draw; and the player class is defining the choices the player can make.

What works
* At the moment, all the tests are passing and four of the 5 pieces of functionality have been implemented (i.e. entering names, presented with choices, player chooses one option, computer chooses random option).

Troubleshooting
* I'm oddly stuck on the params stuff in app.rb. I'm not sure how to get these working properly.
* I'm not sure how to get the flow of the app working and whether to create more .erb files with the various outcomes inside them? Or whether this should be done within the app itself (probably not - skinny controller), or in the various classes themselves. I've just thought myself into a bit of a corner (?!) and not sure how to proceed - hopefully the code review tomorrow will sort this out!
