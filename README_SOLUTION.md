It is a game of rock, paper, scissors.

ruby 2.5.0
gem 'rake'
gem 'sinatra'

  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'rspec'
  gem 'rubocop', '0.56.0'
  gem 'simplecov',
  gem 'simplecov-console',

In order to play please type "rackup" into the terminal form the project dir.

rsp.rb file is the controller, the module code is in the lib directory.
erb files in the views directory.
