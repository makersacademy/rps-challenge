This project creates a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for marketeers to take a break from their work.

Each marketeer will enter their name to begin.

Each marketeer will be presented with three options: rock, paper, scissors and will need to select one.

The marketeer plays against the computer, which will choose one of the three options at random.

The winner will then be declared in the traditional way: 
    rock beats scissors, 
    paper beats rock and 
    scissors beats paper. 
    Should both the marketeer and the computer select the same option, a draw will be declared.
