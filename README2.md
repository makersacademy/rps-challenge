I really enjoyed this challenge.

I have not written enough tests and would like to set up multiple tests for the random computer output, as at the moment, it just tests for one eventuality and the random sample produces three.

My 'result' method is not working properly.
It produces :draw every time. That suggests that app.rb can see and communicate with the result method in the game.rb model, however, I don't think that the game.rb file, or the Game class know what @weapon and @computer_choice are, and this is why the method is not working.

I think this has something to do with the way to get around using global variables.

I want to solve these errors and get the code working as it should.

If i was to redo this challenge, I would force myself to write more tests, at least twice as many i think.
