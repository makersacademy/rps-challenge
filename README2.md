## What was my approach?

Player class is responsible for holding and displaying player choices.

Game class is responsible for determining who wins a round.


## How would I improve it?

- Make it pretty! There are many inconsistencies of style and the lack there of in some views files.

- Further separate the testing suite: too much is held by testing_infrastructure_spec.rb

- Extract the Computer into it's own class.

- Currently Player 2 is instantiated when game is instantiated. This is a waste when playing a single player game. I'd like to find a way to fix while keeping multiplayer functionality.

- When a person doesn't make a choice, it reads "player chose:". I would like to change this to "player did not choose an option".
