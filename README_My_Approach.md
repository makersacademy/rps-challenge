## Weekend 3 - RPS Challenge

First, I drew the process flow diagram to get my head around how the controller should route. Second, I identified that I will be needing Player class and Game class which will handle most of the logic for the game. I wrote tests and started implementing my plan. Once the MVP was reached, I decided to improve the layout of my web pages. Finally, I decided to implement the additional feature of including 'lizard' and 'spock' options to the 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' game.
