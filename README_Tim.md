# The RPS Challenge - Tim Readme

## Where am I with this challenge? 

This challenge is currently incomplete, although I will be looking at it this week in order to complete and have a working game by the end of the week. 

Currently, the `result` method in my `Game.rb` is not pulling in the parameters necessary for it to decide whether it should return win or lose. 

I'm not currently sure why this is happening. 

I have taken inspiration from the exemplar in the `game.rb` strategy of creating a hash of game rules and methods that correspond to the keys and values. I thought this was ingenious and too good to pass up an opportunity to use. 

However, perhaps I wouldn't be having this problem if I were to go about this using the `case` methodology that I had intended to use before seeing this. A matter of hindsight and perhaps something that I will refactor this week. 

I have enjoyed this task, and getting a greater grasp on the server/client relationship. 

Currently, if fired up on a local server, the page will open for a user to input their name and when executed will crash. If you look at the code, the form for the 'rock, paper, scissors' is there, it has worked prior to one of my methods crashing it. 

### What would I do better on this?

1. On reflection, I have not used the TDD process effectively to create this app. When I look to redo this web app I will be following stricter testing. 

2. My diagramming was nowhere near detailed enough. I think, particularly for client/server web apps, detailed diagramming will help me to plan out the app and not hit so many hiccups on the way.
