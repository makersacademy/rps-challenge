This is a simple web game Rock - Paper - Scissors.
To run a game clone project, run bundle and use rackup.

I completed all basic game functionality:

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

I follow TDD approach building this game.
I focus on having MVC structure.

I didn't have time to:
a) remove global variables
b) add css styling
c) add Bonus Levels
