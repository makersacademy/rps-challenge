Created 3 classes:
- a **Bot** class with a **random_choice** method that returns either _rock_, _paper_ or _scissors_.
- a **Player** class initialized with a **name**. It has 3 methods: **choose_rock**, **choose_paper**, **choose_scissors** and returns each objects respectively.
- a **Game** class with 3 methods: **with_rock**, **with_paper**, **with_scissors**. Each methods takes a random_choice as argument and returns a winner following the basic Rock Paper Scissors rules.

Created 2 views:
- **index.erb** - 'the sign_in' page
- **play.erb** - 'where the fun is happening' page

Result:

This is the sign in page where the user can register the name before playing.

This is the first view of the play page, right after you sign in.
You can see points of both the bot and the player. Starting at 0 obviously.  
The choice of both the bot and player will appear respectively.  
3 buttons for the player.

Each turn when the player or bot wins there is a message announcing that. If it's a tie 'Nobody wins' will appear.

I have added a limit to end the game. When either the player or the bot reaches 10 points the game is over.

_Notes_: I know some of my controller are a bit 'fat' üòÖ , I just wanted to show as much as possible in the web app (bot points and random choice, player points and choice, winner at each turn...), and at this moment I couldn't find a way around it. Maybe in the next week with other tools I'll find a better way.. Everything has been TDD. (I just coudn't exactly test the randomness in feature tests but coverage is 99.50%)
