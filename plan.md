As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

Who? - Marketeer
Class - NameRegister

method - add_name
Input                           Output
New name given => [add_name] => Name is registered for the game

What is needed to achieve this?
A homepage that asks for a name
A form to allow user to enter the name
A way that this name is then registered for the game




As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
