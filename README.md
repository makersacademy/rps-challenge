# RPS Challenge

Introduction
------

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard challenge! Written in Ruby on top of Sinatra. 

Instructions for use
-----

Either go to [heroku](https://rps-challenge-spock.herokuapp.com/) or do things the hard way:
- Make sure you have `ruby-2.5.0` installed
- `bundle install` to ensure you have all the gems
- `rackup` to launch the page. Default port is 9292, so you can go to `localhost:9292` in your browser to play.

Approach
--------

Challenge instructions are below. The app was built using strict TDD and the red-green-refactor cycle.
- All `RSpec` tests pass, as does `Rubocop` and there is 100% coverage. 
Both of the bonus extensions have been completed, converting the app to be multiplayer and extending with the 'Spock & Lizard' rules. 
The key design decisions taken were:
- To avoid logic in the `app.rb` class, the creation of a `Game` class
- `Game` has responsibility for orchestrating the game i.e.
    - instructing the pieces to compare themselves and reach the resolution of a game
    - generating the appropriate message to the participants on conclusion
    - resetting the game state when players wish to have another game
- To avoid the use of a global variable, Game is a static class with class instance methods and variables
- To keep the `Game` classes responsibilities light, I decided to handle 'weapon' comparisons in their own class:
    - Mindful of the extensibility required for the Spock and Lizard bonus challenge, I decided to use inheritance to accomplish this
    - (Also from a desire to play around and get more experience with (singleton?) classes)
    - There is an abstract class, `Weapon`, which contains all the methods for comparisons with other weapons
    - Each weapon (`Paper`, `Scissors` etc.) is a subclass of `Weapon` and simply overrides two instance variables showing what weapons they win and lose against
    - This allows the rules to be extended extremely easily in a couple of lines of code. 
    - All subclasses are grouped and tested in the main `weapon.rb` file for convenience. 
- Although this meant completing the bonus challenge was relatively simple, I did encounter many wrinkles when working with class Constants like this
    - For example, the object comparison has to be done with string representations, to avoid `UninitializedConstant` errors, which was disappointing and not as neat as I was hoping for
- I considered a separate `Print` class, but ultimately the `Game` class was pretty light as it stood and there was only a single printing requirement which may not justify the additional abstraction.
- Likewise I considered a `Player` class, but ultimately this would just be a container for `name` and `weapon` instance variables as all the legwork is done in the `Weapon` class
    - I therefore decided that this functionality could just as readily be accomplished by storing these two variables in a session


Challenges
----------

- Difficulty in working with class Constants, as described above. Probably not best practice?
- Returning to the same .erb file (and using `if` statements to show/hide content) caused more trouble than it was worth in the end, so I ended up using more .erb files than originally anticipated. 
    - Need to ask about what best practice is here - simpler `app.rb` at the price of more html duplication between `erb` files? 
- During large refactorings (e.g. switching from an AI to a human 2nd player), I still found it difficult to stick to strict TDD given the sheer number of changes. 
    - Doing the work 'all at once' feels faster, whereas the alternative seems to be multiple refactorings on top of refactorings as a small piece of the changes is moved, everything is refactored, then another small piece is moved etc.
- Attempted at the beginning to do a UML message diagram and didn't find it that clear to accomplish at all
    - In the end, structure was dictated by TDD and the user stories, rather than a 'grand plan'
- Being completely new to CSS, I still find it relatively difficult to make things move where I want. 
    
Instructions
-------

* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared


As usual please start by

* Forking this repo
* TEST driving development of your app


## Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

## Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this at this moment.

Notes on test coverage
----------------------

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
require 'simplecov-console'

SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
  SimpleCov::Formatter::Console,
  # Want a nice code coverage website? Uncomment this next line!
  # SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter
])
SimpleCov.start
```

You can see your test coverage when you run your tests. If you want this in a graphical form, uncomment the `HTMLFormatter` line and see what happens!
