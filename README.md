# RPS Challenge

This is a rock-paper-scissors program where a player is able to enter their name, choose between a rock, paper or scissors, and try to beat the computer.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Installing

Clone the program to your local directory:

## Final Thoughts

I was happy to finish the program however, given more time, I would have made it look prettier using CSS. Also, I would have spent more time on separating out some responsibilities of the Game class into another class to abide by the Single Responsibility Principle.
