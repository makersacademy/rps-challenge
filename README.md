# RPS Challenge

A basic web-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## Installation

Use the Ruby package manager [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) to setup your environment after cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mornevanzyl/rps-challenge.git

gem install bundle

bundle
```

## Usage

```ruby
# t.b.a


```

## Approach
My basic approach to this challenge was to use a ```Player``` class that currently only stores the ```name``` but will allow for further expansion.

The ```Game``` class handles all the game logic including generating random choices when playing against the computer, as well as determining the outcome of the game.
