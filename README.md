# RPS Challenge

his is a project which helped me to practically use the learnings from the following modules :  
  * Introduction to web
  * Object-oriented design
  * Usuage of Sinatra
  * Double, mocking and stubbing
  * Testing with Capybara
  * 
The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked me to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

My task wass to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web.
