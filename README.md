## Implementation

Using TDD I have implemented the methods to build a basic rock, paper, scissors game for the web.

Technologies used:

- Ruby
- RSpec
- Sinatra
- Capybara
- HTML
- CSS

## User experience

- The user enters their name in the first screen of the game and clicks the button to `Start!`.
- The second screen greets the user and ask for a weapon of choice through radio buttons. After clicking the `Fight!` button, the user is redirected to a third screen.
- The final screen gives the result based on the game rules.
