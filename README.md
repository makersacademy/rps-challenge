# Introduction

The intention of this project was to build a working implementation of the popular game Rock, Paper Scissors. As a bonus, the project implemented special rules incorporating five-weapon expansion of the game with ["rock paper scissors Spock lizard"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors#Additional_weapons), as per invention of Sam Kass and Karen Bryla.

This is an individual project created for the Makers Academy week 3 weekend challenge.

This project was built using Ruby, and was structured around the Sinatra framework. The Rspec testing framework was implemented to provide feature and unit testing capabilities, and Capybara was included to allow for testing of front-end elements.

The learning intentions for this project revolved around Sinatra, Rspec and Capybara, and at this point in the Makers Academy curriculum databases have not yet been covered. Due to this global variables have been implemented throughout to assist with persistence, although we have been made well aware that the use of global variables is far from best practice, and that once databases have been addressed we should no longer use them in almost all circumstances.
