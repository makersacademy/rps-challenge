# **Rock Paper Scissors challenge** #

My first web application that lets the Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) play the classic game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer. The user begins on the homepage and fills in their name. The next page will be a selection of weapons and once you've picked one, a results page will tell you what the computer has picked and whether you've won, lost or drew. Massive thanks to my girlfriend for design help and a logo that will be implemented later this week. The full game is available at:
