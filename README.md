This project is our third weekend challenge. This week we were focusing on web applications, learning HTTP and Sinatra. Completed solo on 2nd-3rd June 2018. We were given the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game
```
```
As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

We were also given following behaviour:
- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

## Motivation

This project has been created to give users a chance to play a 1 player game of rock, scissors, paper through their browser.

## Getting started
