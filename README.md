# RPS Challenge

Approach
-------
I built the game first, and the front view second. I have a two classes; a Game class and a Player class. The Player class has the name of the player, the method to allow them to make their move, and stores their move. The Game class - which is started once a player has been created, and is therefore initialized with the player - automatically makes a game move and calculates who's won.

# How to use

Run with rackup and visit localhost:9292. To play again, either go back one page and enter a move again, or go back two pages and start again with a new player.
