## Introduction

This repo contains the code I wrote for the RPS Challenge, the Makers Academy Week 3 end-of-week challenge. This involved creating software for a basic rock-paper-scissors web app with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## My approach

Throughout this challenge I created new coding assets (including .rb and .erb files) through a TDD approach, creating function tests for both code and web app functionality.

Before beginning this challenge, I noted two bonus challenges: change the game from a single-player to a multiplayer game, and expand the 3-item rock-paper-scissors game to a 5-item rock-paper-scissors-spock-lizard game. I therefore began by setting up the project to achieve the user stories in a way that would make completing the bonus challenges easier later on. All code was written with these challenges in mind.

I began by setting up the files I believed would be necessary. This included x3 pages: a sign-in page, a game page, and a results page. I created two classes to support the main app class: Game and Player. I later expanded this to include a Weapon class when I found this might be useful. I created a sign-in page and styled it with CSS and HTML. I then proceeded to a create a page for the game to take place, and a page to display results. Once all functionality was implemented, I formatted the app with CSS and HTML. Once that was done, I expanded the scope of the project as a personal challenge.

Both user stories have been addressed and the bonuses have been completed (see Instructions for use below).

For my own enjoyment and education, I went beyond the required user stories and bonuses in the following 5 ways:

1. I went beyond the requested 5-item system to an extensive 16-item system. As I'd hoped, this proved very challenging and required a lot of planning to devise an appropiate system. I decided to use a system I'm familiar with: the Pokemon weaknesses and strengths system, which I adapted into a rock-paper-scissors-like game using Pokemon characters
2. I introduced image assets from external websites (permissions stated all assets were free for public use) to represent the characters
3. I spent time formatting all .erb files with HTML and CSS to create a relatively aesthetic format
4. I retained the ability to play single-player games as well as multiplayer games
5. I added a system to prevent the game being played if users didn't enter a nam

With more time, I would have done the following:

1. Added credits for the image assets I used (this felt unnecessary as of now as this app is not ready for public use)
2. Investigated how to subsititute global variables and implemented my findings
3. Introduced a scoring system
4. I felt the game.rb file became to extensive; I would decrease this by extracting at least one other Class and a Module

Total rspec testing coverage: 100%; 28 rspec tests; rubocop passed with no offences.

## Instructions for use

### Setup:

1. Clone this repository to a local directory
2. Open a command line and navigate to the cloned directory
3. Enter "rackup -p 4567" into the terminal
4. Open a browser and visit http://localhost:4567 to see the sign-in page

### Interaction:

![Screenshot](./media/screenrecording.gif)

1. Enter a name for Player 1 and press Enter to play a single-player game against the computer. If you also enter a name for Player 2, you will play a multiplayer game
2. Choose a Pokemon for Player 1
3. If playing a multiplayer game, Player 2 will then be prompted to choose their Pokemon
4. You will be presented with the result. Play again, or return to the sign-in page
