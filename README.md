# RPS Challenge

This is my response to the week three weekend challenge to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors web app using Ruby and Sinatra, tested with Capybara and RSpec.  

The app is available at: https://bw-rps.herokuapp.com/

Otherwise:

- clone this repo
- run bundle install
- run rackup (localhost:9292) or ruby app.rb (localhost:4567)

Instructions

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
