# Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge #

Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors. The classic game of strategy, class and a little bit of *luck*. 

For ease of use, everything has been designed to be as user friendly as possible (*lots of buttons*)

To load the game up, first ensure you have a cloned version of the code. Once you have this navigate to the folder in question

```
$ cd some/folder/with/rps/in/it
```

From here you can use ```rackup``` in the console. you should get a bunch of computer stuff (technical I know) load up, but the most important bit is the port number. By taking the port number and searching ```localhost:*port number*``` the game should load for your enjoyment!
