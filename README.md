### Issues with program

- Was unsure if best to put a `/result` view rather than a view for each i.e. `/rock`, `/paper`, `/scissors`. Tried `/result` in my diagrams but found it easier to use a view for each outcome. Not very DRY though.
- Could not implement the last bit of functionality for a winner being declared. I was trying to get it to call the player's choice in the controllers but couldn't achieve the desired result. Plus game logic should go in controllers.
- Was thinking of using logic for winner/ looser along the lines of:

```
def choose_rock
  return "You won this round" if @@computer.choice == :scissors
  draw_or_loose
end

def choose_scissors
  return "You won this round" if @@computer.choice == :paper
  draw_or_loose
end

def choose_paper
  return "You won this round" if @@computer.choice == :rock
  draw_or_loose
end

private

def draw_or_loose
  return "It's a draw" if player.choice == computer.choice
  return "Computer won this round"
end
```

- Used class variables instead of global variables as they are very slightly better (I hope) though still not great to use.
- Struggled writing non-vacuous unit tests. Coverage still at 100% but doesn't feel like it is as well tested as it ought to be.

### Update on struggles

- Also struggled viewing screenshots in this README after uploading them to dropbox.
