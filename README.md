This is my solution to the Makers Academy week 3 challenge. The task is to create a rock paper scissors game that can be played on a local server. This project incorporated HTML, CSS, ERB, Sinatra and the use of Capybara for testing purposes. Following TDD principles, I created an app to meet the following user requirements:
```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## App creation

This app was an opportunity to explore the topics covered in week 3 of the Makers course. MVC architecture, HTTP requests, Basic HTML/CSS and so on.

Sinatra handles all routing within the RPS webapp.
