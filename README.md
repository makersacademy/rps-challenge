## Introduction
  a simple game of rock paper scissor which can be played on browser.

## How to run

### Overall
  a player enters their name and can choose one of three available options. computer takes a random pick and the result is displayed.

  further i wanted to add multiplayer options where if another name is enterd then using a conditional statments i can just create a different game object which instantinate a player object with the name of second player instead of computer and the choice page can have both player's option.
