# Rock Paper Scissors Capybara

This repo is the classic age old game of rock, paper, scissors, Capybara. The player should sign in with their player name. If they are still willing to play, they should initiate a game with the "Start game" button.

The player has four weapons to choose from. The computer will then randomly choose from three weapons (rock, paper and scissors) and the weapons are put against each other.

The result is shown on the next webpage with entertaining gifs depending on the result for the player. A tally is shown with the result of the game and any future games.

The user at this stage has the option to play again.

Unfortunately, Capybaras are not very good at rock, paper, scissors.
