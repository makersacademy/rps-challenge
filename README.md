# Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge

## Task

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Getting Started

1. Run `bundle install` to install necessary gems
1. Run `rackup -p 4567` to start the server
1. Go to [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567)
1. ???
1. Profit

## Notes

Server needs to be started via `rackup` or `shotgun`, rather than directly through `ruby` so that Sass can be compiled correctly.
