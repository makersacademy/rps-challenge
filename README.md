## Introduction

Welcome to my repo for the Makers Academy weekend challenge(3). My task was to create a "rock, paper, scissors' game that can be played on the web by the Makers Academy Marketing Array (MAMA). The game needed to satisfy the requirements below.

## Useage

## Specification

- [x] The marketeer can enter their name before the game.
- [x] The marketeer will then be presented by the available choices (stone, script, or sword).
- [ ] The marketeer can choose one option.
- [ ] The game opponent will then choose a random option in response.
- [ ] The victor celebrates his/her/their win!

## Difficulties

I had a lot of trouble configuring the player hash to include an image (which can then be accessed via the key at a later date). My rspec tests failed repeatedly, to the point where I needed to start again from scratch more than once - hence the one remaining (functional) infrastructure spec. I hope to rectify this problem in the future, so that I can add logic and conditionals to my application with success.
