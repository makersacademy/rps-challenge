# RPS Challenge: 


This task involves creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game on the web, following the user stories below:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Notes: 

The application created involves what I feel is an extremely simplistic representation of an online RPS (rock, paper scissors) game. Nonetheless, the industry expects software developers to ensure they stick to user stories provided, ensuring they do not overcomplicate any tasks set.

With this in mind, my RPS application simply allows users to register their name and play a round of RPS against a computer. This could be used for the foundations of an online RPS site or application, making it possibile to implement any new designs/features according to a client or programmers needs.
