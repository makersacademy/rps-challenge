#Brief
-------

I have been asked to design and build a web application for the Makers Academy Marketing Array which will allow them to play a game of 'Paper, Rock, Scissors'.

#User Stories

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

#Playing the game

Please avoid using Shotgun to run the game.  Otherwise, everything is fairly self-explanatory.

I have also applied the 'special rules' applicable to 'Paper, Rock, Scissors, Spock, Lizard' which are available here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock if you are unfamiliar with them.

#References

In making the game, I included the following image from http://openclipart.org:

#Future functionality

In the future, I would like to add functionality for two human players as well as further improving the style of the application using additional CSS.
