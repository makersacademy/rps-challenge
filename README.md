#Disclaimer

This is not yet a completely finished product. Although I have 100% coverage, one of my tests is still failing.

I'm quite happy with the final product, although I wish I could have implemented three more things:

- display the current_user's name somewhere while that user is playing;
- store the result of each play and, if asked by the user, show the history of results;
- implement a system of points so the user can know if s/he or the computer is winning over several sessions of play;

To do some of that, I could look into opening and writing into files.
