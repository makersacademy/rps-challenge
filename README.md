# Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge

Status
-----

I have completed the two user stories with all functionality.

Known issues
-----

Feature test issues:
- Some of my features tests are only checking for static content rather than the dynamic content it should test for e.g. 'displaying the winner' test in display_winner_spec.rb, 'confirm computer choice' in choose_move_spec.rb.


Task and User Stories
-----

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game
```

```
As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality
- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared
