# RPS Challenge

This project involved using sinatra to model a game of rock paper scissors. The first version had one user register their name and play against the computer, with the second version being a two player game playing against each other. A game class keeps track of turns and declaring a winner, with a player class choosing the users option. This project attempts to follow the model-view-controller design pattern.
