# RPS Challenge

Task
----
The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

My task was to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Functionality

- [x] the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- [x] the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- [x] the marketeer can choose one option
- [ ] the game will choose a random option
- [ ] a winner will be declared

## To use
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:eugeniaguerrero/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle install
$ rackup -p 4567
```
