# RPS Challenge

-------

Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer!

Process
-------

For this project I have built a Rock, Paper, Scissors game following a TDD approach, writing feature tests, then writing unit tests, then
writing the code to pass these tests. 
I accomplished this by using the MVC model, with an app page as the controller, .erb pages for the HTML code, and a ruby class to hold the logic 
of the game.
I then used CSS to tidy up the visuals of the webpages.

Instructions
------------

## To play:
- Clone this github repo to your machine.
- Run 'bundle' to install the required gems.
- Run 'rackup' to get the server running
- Enter 'http://localhost:9292/' into your browser
- Enter your name and choose your weapon! Good Luck!

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## Extra Features

With a bit more time I intend to add functionality to allow a two-player game to be played, instead of against the computer.
