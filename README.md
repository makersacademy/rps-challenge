###Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge###

The purpose of the Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge is to test the knowledge of and skills in BDD, TDD, OOP and web-integration gained over the previous few weeks to build a working two-player version of the classic game ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’ (Lizard, Spock optional!). It utilises Ruby for the game engine, with testing of the terminal version using Capybara and RSpec, with the web interface generated using Sinatra and tested using Cucumber. The challenge is outlined in the [Instructions](./Instructions.md) and is to be completed over the bank-holiday weekend, and the progress submitted by 09:00 on Tuesday 7th April.
