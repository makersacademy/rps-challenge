# RPS Challenge

Task

So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

* the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
