# RPS Challenge

## Objective

The goal behind this project was to become more confident setting up a sinatra web app. Making use of th MVC design structure. Delivering a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors for the use of MAMA to enjoy on downtime.
I have created the multiplayer in a way that both players don't have to trust the other and have the option to change their minds before committing to the final battle.

## Issues

Some rackup ports didn't reflect given CSS. Please use port directed below.

## Installation

Fork and clone from [here](https://github.com/ShinyVerse/rps-challenge)

Once in the cloned folder in your Terminal remember to run:
```
bundle
```

## Use

When running the programme please run from this rackup port:

```
rackup -p9000
```
This port ensures you will get the up-to-date CSS and functionality.
