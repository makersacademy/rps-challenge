## How it works? ##
### Set up ###
To set up the game of the season you need to clone this repo.

Once you are in the directory install required gems. Use bundler:

If you do not have bundler on your PC
```
gem install bundler
```
will sort it for you :)
Just one step from the game. Now just type.

You can use different port if you prefer.
