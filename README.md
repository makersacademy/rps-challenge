# RPS Challenge

I was tasked this week with building a game using the skills that I have gained this week at [Maker's Academy](www.makersacademy.com). The skills I have gained this week revolve around the Web. I learnt about HTTP protocols, Sinatra and built on some basic HTML and CSS skills that I previously had. I also learned about feature testing with Capybara and built on my RSpec testing skills. I used all these newfound skills and knowledge to create this web application.

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
## Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Rules

The rules in the words of Sheldon Cooper:
>Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

## How to run

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:kittysquee/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle
$ rackup
```

Rackup will enable you to visit 'localhost:9292' on your web browser and play my game. When you've had enough RPS excitement you can kill the server by entering `ctrl` + `c`.

I hope you has as much fun playing this game as I did building it! ðŸŽ‰
