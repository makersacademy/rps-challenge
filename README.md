# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is my solution to the challenge found at this repo https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge

To play:
Navigate to the file you want to clone the repo to and enter
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AdamusBG/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle install
$ rackup -p 9292
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:9292/ in your browser

After inputting your name, you will play against a computer.
Your choice of rock, paper or scissors will be decided by a button press.
The computer's decision will be randomised.
You will receive the appropriate win or draw message.
The game will also keep track of your score and the computers.
