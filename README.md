Rock Paper Scissors
==================

The seventh program I built during my programming bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). 

Objective
------------

The Makers Academy Marketing team have asked to be provided with game. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to let off a little steam.

The objective is to provide a rock paper scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing a game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
