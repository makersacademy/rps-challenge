# Project title

Rock, Paper Scissors (RPS) is the week 3, weekend project from Makers Academy. Used to practice web application development and associated skills.

### Motivation

This project was made to develop my ability to construct a web application, another progression in my journey to become a developer.

### Build status

The project is currently under construction, it may not be completed as this is a practice exercise to build myskills.  

### Screenshots

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX I maybe want to include photos of the class diagrams and system diagrams here? Or a screenshot of the landing page?

### Task / User Stories

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

#### Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

#### Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

#### Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )
