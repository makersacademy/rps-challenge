# Flaws of the Application.
- The application is currently not working properly because of a login inside the game model. This is what is happening behind the scene.

The method ``random_choice`` returns a random object from the array anytime it is called. This means the object being return by ``random_choice`` in the ``choice method`` is different from the object being returned by ``random_choice`` in the ``results method``. The returend value of these two methods are being used in the view to show the shape that the computer and the user chose and the winner of the game, but since they all have different random choice the real winner of game is sometimes wrong as inllustrated ihe image below.

Basically I was right! I was calling two different object anytime the
``random_choice`` method was called in the application. After an advice from **[Chembo](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi)**, a new method ``computerchose`` was used to store the  computers choice and then later used in the ``choice method `` and ``results method ``.
