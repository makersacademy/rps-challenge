# RPS Challenge

### Rock, Paper Scissors

For this challenge I used the knowledge gained from the previous week learning to build web apps, the basic format for my solution to this problem was fairly simple, for the first user story, I had to save the user's name, which I did by building an HTML form, and saving the input as an instance variable of a Player class object, this Player object is in turn saved as an instance variable of a Game class object, then I took the user's choice of Rock, Paper or Scissors, saving that as an instance variable as well, and ran it, as well as a randomly generated move through a method to decide the outcome of the game, finally announcing the winner
