# RPS Challenge

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## INCLUDES Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Two marketeers can play against each other.

## INCLUDES Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Uses the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )

#### HOW TO PLAY

1. Clone the repo!
2. Run bundle install
3. From the root, run ruby app.rb
