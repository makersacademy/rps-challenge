# RPS Challenge

First attempt at producing Sinatra app for a rock, paper, scissors game - currently application can be run and the user types in their move - tried to implement drop-down but was struggling to use the return value, so more time required to get working. Computer player move is hard-coded to paper, which I was using to test game logic was working, which it is currently, so just need to add the complete logic and randomise the computer's turn.

Testing coverage is at best, very poor and needs looking at - was struggling to implement functionality, so spent more time trying that at the expense of TDD but I think I am now going in the right direction, although I have not been able to dedicate time over weekend to work on it.

Seems like I was spending a lot of time 'messing' with Sinatra etc to work out what was going on and I definitely learned a lot although it took me longer than I'd hoped to get there, so not happy with the end result. I would hope to spend more time on it to get it into a much better state.
