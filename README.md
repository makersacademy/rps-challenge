# Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge

Task
----

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked for a game of _Rock, Paper, Scissors_. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little!

 This programme provides a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Functionality:

- the marketeer can enter their name before the game
- the marketeer is presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

The game is available to play on Heroku. [Check it out here!](https://rosieposie.herokuapp.com/)
