#### Problems encountered:

1. Storing the User's weapon choice as a session.

-I had planned on having a post-redirect-loop(similar to the /names post request) for when the User chooses their weapon. I wanted to store this memory in session params, however I struggled to then pass this as an argument to the RPSLS class.

-This means that I had to have views for each weapon choice, and I had to hard-code the argument to the RPSLS class

#### Test coverage 100%

Testing covers all cases of User and Computer winning, losing and drawing. Also tests for the correct output and storage of 'name' using Sinatra sessions.
