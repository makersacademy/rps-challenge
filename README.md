===============================

The task was to build a game of rock, paper, scissors that a user could play on the web.

**Features of the game included:**
* User can register their name before playing;
* The user can play a game of RPS against a computer;
* The user is presented with choices (rock, paper or scissors);
* The user can choose one of those options;
* The game will generate a random option;
* A winner will be declared.

*This will be updated later on as I proceed with the challenge.*
