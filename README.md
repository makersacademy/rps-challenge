## Methodology

This implementations of RPSpockLizard uses a `Player` and `AIPlayer` classes with
overloaded decision making methods, so that they can be called interchangeably
whether there is a human player or not within the `app.rb` code. The `Game` class
manages basic game logic running and stores game state in a `@game` class variable.
The `choices` class is simply an easily accessible wrapper for classes to get
the different possible game choice possibilities. The indexes of the `CHOICES`
constant array also act as a look up table for the numeric values of the choices.

## Victory Matrix

Win conditions in the game are calculated using a victory matrix class which
places the different outcomes in a possibility grid and returns an invalid player index
or `nil` for draws and the winning players player index inside the game class
if there was a victor. Here the values are encoded alphabetically as 'Rock', 'Paper',
'Scissors', 'Vulcan', 'Lizard'.
