# RPS Challenge

Task
----
The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Completed using the special rules of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (_you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock )_


Completed with all functionality, although not tested the results page as couldn't stop the random outcome of the computer choice in app as a feature test but tested fully as unit tests.

Would like to have improved views with better html if I had more time.
