# RPS Challenge

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

```
Come on and play Rock Paper and scissors!
- git clone [git repo url]
- cd rps-challenge
- Run bundle (if bundle already installed, else gem install bundle, then bundle install)
- ruby app.rb
- navigate to localhost:9292
- start playing the game, enjoy!
```
