This is a rock paper scissors web application. No more- but definitely no less. It's fantastically crafted in pure ruby. It's tested to tasted with a capybara, and rspec cocktail fusion of retrospective that'll just about knock you dead. Multiplayer doesn't work quite yet.. So, for the time being, just play in one player mode #beta-version. All you have to do, is register with a funny nickname, choose either rock, paper, or scissors, press submit, and try not to wiz from all the excitement!! Enjoy- thank you, thank you, and thank you. Merry Christmas, and goodnight.
