# Rock-Paper-Scissors Challenge - Solution

## About

This is my solution to the Rock-Paper-Scissors challenge. The aim of this exercise was to test-drive a simple web application that lets you play rock-paper-scissors against the computer.

## Approach

I felt quite shaky building a web application, so I built a cli-version of the game first and used the same back-end to convert the app to a web application.
