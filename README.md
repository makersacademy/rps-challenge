## My notes
* With the stubbing now successfully implemented for the random outputs generated by the computer, I now embark on displaying the outcome of the game, whether that be win, lose or draw. 
* Otherwise, all tests passing so far with high test coverage, no issues flagged by rubocop and the game is running smoothly in the browser.
