# RPS Challenge

The task was to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with the option to play multiplayer or against the computer. Here were the user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
When you visit the web app the page you are greeted with is an option to play a 1 player game or a 2. You are then taken to a page to enter the names or a name in the case you chose 1 player. 

1 player games will match you up against the CPU that will select a weapon randomly. 2 player games will take turns in deciding which weapon.

After weapon is chosen you are sent to a page where it will tell you what the match up was and who won. You are then asked whether you would like to play again or not.

If you do want to play again, you will be sent back to the page to choose a weapon and you will see the new score at the top. This is updated after each round.

If not, you will be sent to a page which will give you the final score and tell you if you have won or lost.

I really enjopyed this challenge and although if given more time I would of added a bit more CSS and also refactored some of my tests to use web-helper. All in all I learnt alot and looking forward to see what week 4 has in store.
