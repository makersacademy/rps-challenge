# RPS Challenge: Rōnin Badge Test

Game Logic
-------
* This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Ruby with the Sinatra framework, tested with Rspec and deployed on Heroku at https://glacial-refuge-4338.herokuapp.com/?
* There is a single class called 'Game' with a selection of 6 methods. One method requests the users choice, one sets the computers choice, 3 methods together decide if it's a win, lose or draw. 1 method displays the result.
* The game logic works as follows in irb:
  *   game = Game.new
  *   game.user_choice("scissors")
  *   game.comp_decision
  *   game.result
* Enter the project directory and type in 'rackup' to create a server, visit the local    host in your browser via the port specified, or play the game online at https://glacial-refuge-4338.herokuapp.com/?


Instructions
-------
* Challenge time: Friday, the entire day + the weekend if you need it
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared


As usual please start by

* Filling out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan_september2015 (if you haven't already)
* Forking this repo
* TEST driving development of your app

**Rōnin BANZAI!!!!**

## Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

## Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

Notes on test coverage
----------------------

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'coveralls'
require 'simplecov'

SimpleCov.formatters = [
  SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
  Coveralls::SimpleCov::Formatter
]
Coveralls.wear!
```

Note that you can replace `Coveralls.wear!` with  `SimpleCov.start` to get coverage stats locally
Then run `open coverage/index.html` from the command line to view details
