# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a version of the classic game 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' played against a computer opponent in the browser.

This execution utilises Ruby 2.4.1, Sinatra, Capybara and Rack with Rspec for testing.

## Setup
Clone the repository and run using the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:edpe/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle
$ rackup
```
Open your favourite browser and navigate to localhost:9292

## Testing
Run the test suit using Rspec in terminal:

```
$ rspec
```

Choose your weapon and find out if the computer managed to get the better of you!

Not this time, but the benefit of screenshots is that you can run the software multiple times until you win. As I did, click 'Play again' to have another go.
