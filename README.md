So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Instructions

```sh

To run:
$ gem bundle install
$ ruby ruby.app

http://localhost:4567/

```
## Method

The app allows two variations of the classic game 'Rock, Paper Scissors': one-player versus a randomised computer response, or two-player head to head.

In the first instance the player chooses a weapon and a '.sample' function selects a weapon at random from an array of weapons. In two-player mode the weapon chosing process is split over two screens allowing users to pick without the opposition seeing their choice.

Once weapons are selected they're passed to a Game class which uses an array of key-value pairs to compare weapons and deduce a winner.

## Evaluation

- views classes could be named better, maybe space to refactor here
- routing could be tighter maybe, ran out of time to experiment further
- would be nice to make result screen image reflect winning weapon
