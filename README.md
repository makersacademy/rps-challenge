# RPS Challenge: Rōnin Badge Test

## Completion notes

### Current status

I've failed to get this one working in time. Wasn't a great weekend, and the time I did have I spent more on relatively minor aspects of the project such as figuring out how to stub methods in Cucumber. The initial design and code phases worked fine, but cascading that down into actual code turned into spaghetti. A large part of that was the transition from Sinatra frontend code to backend unit tests and code. Another large part was trying to fit it into an OO framework and falling over - injecting players into the game made everything horrible. Annoying, as I could manage a basic RPS game playable through IRB in minutes.

### Domain modelling

The following are the main components of the actual program:

* Sinatra class and ERB files for the UI. GET / for the homepage, GET and POST /play for in-progress games, and GET /gameover for completed games.
* Session cookies for user identification.
* Game class to store individual games. Contains Player objects through dependency injection. Has .points_required method which returns the number of points required to win the game (passed in via initial argument), and game_over? method to return if a player has won the game.
* Player class to store individual players. Has .play method which returns :rock, :paper, :scissors, and .autoplay method to return one selected at random. Has .won_game? method to check if the player has lost the game. Has .points method to see score for current player.
* Tbc: some way of selecting and storing whether a player is a bot or a real person.
* Tbc: add support for Spock and Lizard.

### User stories

The user stories are turned into Cucumber features and scenarios.

User story under development:

> As a marketeer
> So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
> I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

Completed user stories:

> As a marketeer
> So that I can see my name in lights
> I would like to register my name before playing an online game

### Order of development

I'm test driving from the UI downwards. Here’s how the development order goes, running cucumber after each step and cycling back to the top each time I run out of test failures:

1. Set up the server and software stuff
2. UI feature tests in /features
3. Step definitions and paths file lurking in /features
4. Main Sinatra web app program in /lib
5. ERB templates in /views
6. RSpec unit tests in /spec
7. Backend code in /lib


## Original instructions


Instructions
-------
* Challenge time: Friday, the entire day + the weekend if you need it
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared


As usual please start by

* Filling out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan (if you haven't already)
* Forking this repo
* TEST driving development of your app

**Rōnin BANZAI!!!!**

## Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

## Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )
