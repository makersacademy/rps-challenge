# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Task

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
Hints on functionality

the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
the marketeer can choose one option
the game will choose a random option
a winner will be declared

Bonus level 1: Multiplayer
Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( yes there are two of them ).

Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard
Use the special rules ( you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock )

Basic Rules
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
