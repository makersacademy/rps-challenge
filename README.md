[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tso402/rps-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tso402/rps-challenge)

The focus of this project is to implement a web app that provides the user with a single player rock paper scissors game

The following user stries were considered when delivering the functionality.

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

The feature and unit tests for this app can be run from the project root directory using command 'rspec'
