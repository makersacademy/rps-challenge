Task
----

It's my third week at Makers.In this challenge I was set the task of creating an interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors app that could be run via Sinatra onto a local host and played on a browser.

Here are the user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared
