# RPS Challenge

Task
----
This challenge was given to us as our third weekend challenge at Makers Academy. It enabled me to practice building simple web applications and follow an effective debugging process for web applications. I managed to successfully complete all the User Stories but if given more time I would like to practice with CSS and HTML to style the game better. The instructions were as follows:

"Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

## Basic Rules
