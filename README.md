# RPS Challenge

## Overview

Maker Academy Weekend Challenge (week 3). We had to use test drive development to make a web app for the game rock, paper, scissors. We were provided with the following user stories & hints on functionality.

Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared
