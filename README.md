Task
----

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

My approach
-------
* Followed similar design process to feature testing for [Battle challenge](https://github.com/alexscotttonge/Battle_Challenge)
* Used buttons to simulate users choice of rock, paper or scissors
* Created **Computer** and **Player** class in the Model
* Functionality to be completed:
  - Comparing Player and Computer weapon choices
  - Displaying weapon choices on relevant pages
