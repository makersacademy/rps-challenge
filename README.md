## <a name="Task">The Task</a>

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little. Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the below user stories.

This challenge is the third weeked challenge at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy).

## <a name="Installation">Installation Instructions</a>

1. Fork this repository, clone to your local machine then change into the directory:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:davmcgregor/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
```
2. Load dependencies with bundle:
```
$ gem install bundle
$ bundle
```
3. Run Rspec for tests and coverage, then rubocop for linting
```
$ rspec
$ rubocop
```
4. Run the app on a local server and play on the broswer: http://localhost:4567/

```Shell
$ rackup config.ru -p 4567
```

## <a name="Functional_Description">Functional Description</a>

As part of the system's functionality:

* The marketeer can enter their name before the game
* The marketeer is presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
* The marketeer can choose one option
* The game chooses a random option
* A winner is declared

### Basic Rules

```
## <a name="Methods">Objects & Methods</a>

For the user stories I created a domain model for each object, including attributes and behaviour:
