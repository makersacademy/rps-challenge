# RPS Challenge

Client brief
-------

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked me to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time let off some steam.

My task was to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web.

How to run this program
-------
* Follow this [link](http://localhost:9292/) to the game.
* Click on 'Enter'
* Fill in your name

**User Stories**
```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared


Given the user stories and functionality hints above my first step was to create a process diagram to help me think about how I was going to put this website together. I used Miro to create a *very* messy diagram that helped me plan and visualise how my MVC workflow was going to make my website work.

For my first user story I decidec to make my homepage a welcoming page inviting the user to play 'rock, paper, scissors' by clicking the 'enter' button. My reasoning for doing this instead of getting straight into the sign-in page was that this would make it easier for me to add new functionality such as letting the user choose if they wanted to play against the computer or against a friend.

Once that was implemented I then created a sign-in page let my user fill in their name and fulfill this user story.

Reflections
-------
I am part way through completing the final user story that displays the result of the game. Once I have finished I will go back and use a css design to make the game more visually pleasing.
