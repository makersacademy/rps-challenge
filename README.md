# How I Found This Challenge
----

I found this weekend challenge really fun to complete. It was tough to get my head around the domain model but very satisfying to work on and see the game coming together as it was made. I was realyl difficult not to aim for the bonus features but rather implement the basic features first. I must continue to remember to break problems down into smaller pieces in order to complete challenges. I must remember to "divide and conquer". Overall I feel really pleased with the sucess I had and really enjoyed working out the MVC for this and how it all fits together.
