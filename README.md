# Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge #

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

#Approach#

I decided to keep functionality as basic as possible, the player can enter their name and choose a 'weapon'.
There is a player class, a game class and a robot player class which automatically generates a random weapon choice.

#How to use#
run ```ruby app.rb``
navigate to ```localhost:4567/``` in your browser
