# RPS Challenge

Overview
-------

* A simple game of rock paper scissors lizard spock
* Player enters their name & then play against the computer
* the computer generates a random choice & the result is then shown on the next page

Approach
--------

* I used a mathematical game calculator to calculate who wins - allowing new weapons to be added with ease (two at a time) and only styling changes will be required
* I focused mainly on styling for this challenge

* multiplayer feature added as an experiment and NOT test driven. 
* some tests have been added but full coverage not expected.
* tests still need to be added and some html changes to result pages
