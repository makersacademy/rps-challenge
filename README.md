As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

- Using TDD, I started by creating a web app that allow the user to enter their name and choose rock, paper or scissors.
- I then created a file called game.rb which contained the game logic.
- I also added a player class to allow the user to have a name
- I added a computer class which choose an option randomly.
- I then added a result page which would declare the winner
- I added a button that allows the user to play again
- I added the option to play a multiplayer game: 2 players can add their names, each choose an option and then see the winner
- I then added 2 options to the game: lizard and Spock
- I added the option to start a new game after a game ends
- Having finished implementing its functionality ,I used css to make it look nice
