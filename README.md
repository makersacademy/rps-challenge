# RPS Challenge

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

# Thoughts and approach

This challenge was designed to build upon what we learnt this week in web week. Capybara and I were not getting on at first but once the correct `Capybara.app = RPS` was added to `spec_helper` we were good to go.
I found that the building of the site using HTML/CSS was not too difficult, although very time consuming. The issues came when implementing the Ruby classes. What I struggled most with and will be a major part of my goals for the upcoming week, was trying to implement class methods in place of sessions. No matter what I tried, all the tests would break and not return what I was hoping for. Having done some further reading I have a better idea of what I would do in future and will spend some on a test program until I get my head around it.
This was a great challenge to boost my limited HTML knowledge and get the basics of how to inject some CSS to make things pretty.
