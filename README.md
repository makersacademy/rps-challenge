Rock Paper Scissors Challenge
==================


![id](https://github.com/Corina/rps-challenge/blob/master/public/for_readme.jpg?raw=true)


A Rock, Paper, Scissors web app where 2 players can play against each other. The first page displays a short story with the 3 characters.

The first page ask for players names, if none are given the game uses the default names. The first player must be *human* and is forced to make a choice between the 3 options but the second player can skip choosing and the computer will chose instead.

There are 2 modes of playing:
- sudden death: the game stops after one round
- best 3 out of five: score is kept for 5 games and results are announced after each round as well as the overall winer
