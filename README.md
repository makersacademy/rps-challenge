Reflections
-------
Really enjoyed this challenge. It has been really cool to apply what I learned during the week (e.g. setting up a web framework using Sinatra or implementing CSS style sheets).
I have started reading Sandi Metz's [POODR](http://www.poodr.com/), which turned out to be very useful with regards to trying and keeping the code as _DRY_ as possible and following the _Single Responsibility Principle_.
I still rely on walkthroughs and code written by students from previous cohorts (@lwkchan and @serenahathi's code provided me with several interesting inputs); however, I am beginning to feel slightly less like a _knob_ and understand concepts that where pretty much obscure to me in the previous two weeks (e.g. mocks and stubs). It's still a long way to go, but I feel much more confident. Also, my domain modelling skills still require further improvement.

To do (someday)
-------
- Allow two players to play the Game
- Implement _Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard_
- Improve CSS design
