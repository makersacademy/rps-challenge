# RPS Challenge

Welcome to the rock paper scissors game!

In this game, the user is directed to a home page that asks for them to input their name. The user then is directed to the play page where they select rock paper or scissors from a drop down menu. When they confirm their selection, the computer also selects an option randomly and the final page tells them who won, and what each of them selected for transparancy sake.
