# RPS Challenge

The task at hand was to create a Web App that represents the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The features that were created were accompanied by Rspec and Capybara tests. As each new feature was added I used the server to make sure the code didn't break. 

## User Stories

```

So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game
```
```
As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```


## Functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## How to Use:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run 'gem install bundle'
3. Run 'bundle'
4. From the command line, run rackup -p 4567 and visit 'http://localhost:4567'

## Steps

1. Write a test so the user can enter their name.
2. Write the code so the name is displayed when user presses play.
3. Write the test and code for the Rock, Paper, Scissors buttons.
4. Write test and code for displaying which button was selected.
5. Create a computer option which generates a button at random.
6. Write test and code to decide winner.

## Learnings

This challenge enabled me to further build on the week3 objectives:

1. Build a simple web app
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications

I would have liked to complete the computer option, and deciding a winner, as well as being able to implement some CSS.
