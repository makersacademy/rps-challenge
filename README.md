# Rock, Paper, Scissors... Spokc, lizard Web Game

Alexis Morcrette's solution to the Makers Academy week 3 Weekend Challenge.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to absence during weekend because of a bereavement discussed with coaches, I have not been able to engage fully with weekend challenge this week. Solution is submitted and with bugs. Nevertheless, first user story complete, and additional functionality also test drived.**

## Scenario

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

### Bonus functionality

Using bonus rules of Spock and lizard.
