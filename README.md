# RPS Challenge: R≈çnin Badge Test

Task 
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

How I went about this task
----

* I started with the first user story where a player could register their name and play. This went without mush of an issue.
* The next user story was slightly longer as it was to let the player play a game of rock, paper, scissors.
* Once I created the tests for how they should work I set up some buttons for the user to choose (one for each choice).
* Next I had to create some methods for generating a computer choice and another for working out who won.
* The main problem I ran into was trying to stub out the randomness of the computers choice so I could say win/lose/draw.
* After getting past that problem I finished up the website to loop back around if a player wanted to have a rematch against the computer.
* The final part was using css to try and make the front end look good. This is by far the area I have the least knowledge so it involved spending most of the time on the internet for tags and images.
