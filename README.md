# RPS Challenge: R≈çnin Badge Test

This challenge is taken from Maker's Academy week 3. The challenge is to satisfy the user stories below my building a simple web application.

As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

The web application will simulate the classic game of rock paper scissors. A user will log in with their name and be presented with 3 options to click (rock,paper, scissors).

On the the next paper you will be presented with the outcome of the game. Win, lose or draw based on what the computer has chosen at random.
