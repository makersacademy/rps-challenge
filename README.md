Rock Paper Scissors Challenge

About
--
This is my solution to the third of the weekend challenges completed as part of the Makers Academy course. The project aims to fulfill the following user stories:
```
The marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game starts.
The marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors).
The marketeer can choose one option.
The game will choose a random option.
A winner will be declared.
```
