# RPS Challenge

Instructions
-------

* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared


As usual please start by

* Forking this repo
* TEST driving development of your app

# Plan for completeing the task

#### Website Side

get '/' - form to enter a name  pointing to post '/name'

post 'name' - save name in a session redirect to get '/move'

get '/move' - option to pick more (R,S,P) pointing to post '/selected_move'

post '/selected_move' - save selected, redirect to get '/result'

get '/result' - interact with code to find out result, shows result
                option to return to get '/move'


#### Code Side

\#computer move - Array.sample
winning hash [R: S, P: R, S: P]
\#result(player move)

### Comments About Used Resources

mostly for checking syntax, I used the repository made for the battle (this weeks afternoon challenge) and also [Tristian's Birthday App one](https://github.com/tristanlangford/birthdaygreeterV2) for the RPS selection HTML syntax.

## Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

### Plan

On name page have two names in the form (if player_2 is nil then run single player)
if multiplayer run similar code but on two separate pages ask of a user move.
Then compare using the same hash to find out the winner, button to play again

### Changes

This went ok, but did refactor the model into a Game class holding the player names and moves.

## Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )

### Plan

option on start to play RPSSL
add the addition options to the winning hash, and in computer move - RPSSL random_move

### Changes

No real changes but was a little stumped about the return value from #random_move before realising than an if statement also returns a value, so I had to explicitly return a value if rpssl wasn't chosen.

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this at this moment.

Notes on test coverage
----------------------

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
require 'simplecov-console'

SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
  SimpleCov::Formatter::Console,
  # Want a nice code coverage website? Uncomment this next line!
  # SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter
])
SimpleCov.start
```

You can see your test coverage when you run your tests. If you want this in a graphical form, uncomment the `HTMLFormatter` line and see what happens!
