# RPS Challenge: Week3

Task
----

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Checklist
----

- [x] Basic 1 player web game of Rock, Paper, Scissors
- [x] Multi-player version (in master branch >> no styling)
- [x] Special rules web game Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard (in separate branch - 1player)

Commentary/ To-do
----

* Adopted a BDD approach employing Cucumber for UI and Rspec for backend >> 90%+ coverage. Final Cucumber test requires finalising.
* Added basic CSS template styling as highlighted in screenshots >> further features and styling to be added
* Launched previous master version on Heroku >> new 1player version pending
* Multiplayer game functions as an MVP on functionality but UI requires further work
