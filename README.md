# Rock Paper Scissors Interactive Web Game

Description
-------

This is my initial version of an online interactive Rock Paper Scissors game that can be played within your browser. It allows the user to:

* Register their name before playing an online game
* Play rock/paper/scissors against the computer

Build Status

WIP. Basic functionality has been implemented. Need to remove the use of global variables.

In the future I would like to add functionality to play against another person or the computer and give the option to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard.
