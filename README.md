# RPS Challenge

Task:

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.
Our task was to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for MAMA so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

My program and app

- The game can be played either in IRB or using the web application, as a one player game where the user plays against the computer.
- An instance of the 'Game' class is initialised with a player (instance of class 'Player') and an opponent (instance of class 'Opponent')
- The player then has the ability to choose rock, paper or scissors (game.player.choose('rock' or 'paper' or 'scissors') - an error message is raised both in IRB and in my web application if the player tries to input anything other than one of those options.
- The opponent's choice is randomly selected from the three options. 
- game.outcome tells the player if they've won, lost or drawn based on the basic rules.

Things I'd like to implement

- Web app currently has no css - would like to work on this so it's nicer to look at!
- Wanted to use buttons instead of a text input for the players choice, but couldn't get this to work - when I tried to set it up the choice was not being passed into url in params
