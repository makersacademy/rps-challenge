# RPS Challenge

The RPS challenge is the third weekend challenge at Makers Academy. The request
was to build an app to simulate a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The instructions
can be found in the "INSTRUCTIONS.md" file.

This is my proposed solution using Ruby.

The main class in this project is Game. A game consists of a Player, a Computer
and a Judge.

The user runs the app, enters his name and clicks play. The system welcomes him
and asks him to pick a weapon.

When the user picks a weapon from the options given the app tells the player to
pick the selected weapon from the weapons cabinet. After this, it tells the
computer to pick a weapon randomly from its weapon cabinet.

When both enemies are ready, the game checks the weapons and asks for the judge
call (he will check the rulebook and hand down the verdict).

Finally the result of the fight is shown in a fancy way.
