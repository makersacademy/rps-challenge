# RPS Challenge


# Project Breakdown

While I was unable to complete everything due to illness this weekend, I was happy with what I did achieve. I was able to include extra features to my app that weren't absolutely necessary for the challenge, such as styling and backgrounds. I also added an extra page, which in my opinion improved the user friendliness of the app. I was also successfully able to use a stub to test the randomness of the game. If there was anything I would have liked to work on more, it would be getting my ruby code to interact with the app page. This is something I was unable to get around to doing this weekend, and therefore there is some unconnected code created in my lib file that does not yet interact with the actual webpage.
