Approach
---
I decided that in order to have a MVP I wanted to have as much as possible of the logic and testing in place in both the back end and the front end before working on the user interface.

I followed the usual BDD/TDD approach to creating the logic behind the app, and tried to be as thorough as possible in testing edge cases.

My design decisions were in part made with a view that the app might be extensible as, given more time it would interesting to consider similar games with different rule sets.

While I was able to implement the required core functionality, I have not been able to add to the HTML and CSS in the timeframe allowed. This is certainly something I would look to improve were I to continue working on the app.
