✅ High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)\
✅ The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

## Skills used:

- Capybara testing
- Class interaction
- Basic styling



## Shortcomings:
- The RSpec tests are patchy and should be more thorough.
- The styling format should be neater within the erb files.
