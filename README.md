# RPS Challenge: R≈çnin Badge Test

This is the 3rd weekend challenge for Ronin. The challenge involves making a web application for the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

The instructions for this challenge can be found on the Makers site [here] (https://github.com/missamynicholson/rps-challenge).

I will be following the same process as I did for Battle Web in order to complete this challenge. The Battle Web Challenge instructions can be found [here] (https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/intro_to_the_web/00_challenge_map.md).
This challenge used Capybara and Selenium and the aim was to Test Drive development of a MVC compliant web application.
My repo for the Battle Web Challenge can be found [here] (https://github.com/missamynicholson/Battle).
