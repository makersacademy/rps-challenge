# RPS Challenge

Makers Academy Weekend Challenge - Week 3
-----------------------------------------

For this week's challenge, we were asked to build a simple web app version of _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ using the Sinatra, TDDing using Capybara/RSpec.

We were given the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

And the following hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

Unfortunately, I did not have time to implement the bonus features of adding a multiplayer option, or enabling _Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock_. If I worked on this further, I would definitely like to implement those features. Additionally (although it is, of course, already a masterpiece of graphic design...), my main priority would be to add some CSS to make it more visually appealing: add some colours, probably add some icons or images to represent the different moves, style the forms and buttons a bit more elegantly, and add some transitions, especially for the header elements in the final page (including transition delay, so that the player's move appears first, then the computer's, and finally the outcome). In terms of functionality, I would also add buttons on the outcome page for 'Play again?' or 'Different player(s)', directing users back to '/play' and '/' respectively.
