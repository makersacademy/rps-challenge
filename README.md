I've complete the challenge of creating a web application in which a user can sign up with their name and play a game of RPS vs a CPU. 

I've included screenshots of the game in action in the Screenshots folder. 

Improvements I could have made would be to set a maximum score which redirects to a winner page when it is reached by the player or the CPU. I could have also included the option for 2 player mode, however I did not due to time constraints.
