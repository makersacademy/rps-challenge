#RPS challenge
**Week 3** weekend challenge *in progress*

##What will it do?
A web app that will take a player's name and choice of rock, paper or scissors and play against the computer. It will output the winner.

##How does it work?
Player starts a new game by entering their name. They then choose rock, paper or scissors. This will then show their choice vs. the computer's randomised choice. (The rest will follow...!)


##What still needs to be done?
Currently only has functionality up to the point of player 1 entering their choice of rock, paper or scissors and the computer's randomised choice. It isn't showing player 1's choice on the next page however.
I also still need to implement the "rules" of winning, losing and tying - and showing the winner on screen.
