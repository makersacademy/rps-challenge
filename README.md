This is the week 3 weekend challenge, here we were required to impliment a simple web app to allow someone to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. My approach was to TDD the app, views and model, and this was surprisingly hard as the model is very simple, and while I was able to get good coverage I had issues with capybara and stubbing randomness.

While the fundemental coding for the RPS game itself is quite simple, it did take me a while to understand the usage of HTML forms and button properties, and spent some time on W3Schools and their HTML tutorials. In the rpsec tests for the model (rps.rb), were easier to write than expected, though I was unable to get the tests to work when trying to stub out the .sample method, as such I did then resort to stubbing the Kernel as per the example in https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/doubles.md . Getting capybara to test the website, was also quite simple, until I was trying to TDD the results page, here I was unable to write a test that could be stubbed and thus give a particular result. I could do with some guidance on this, especially in this case. I did consider changing the model so that the computers move was generated by its own class, and would be passed in to rps.rb, however I didnt think that it would make the capybara test any easier to write as the behaviour would still need to be stubbed. 

As such while the program works and I was able to fulfil the basic requirements, I am not happy as I have not been able to fully test the app, the offending test is currently commented out, and as I was unable to test the victory screen, I was also unable to test the defeat and draw screens respectively. Though by running rackup and actually visiting the page I could see that the page displays, but I am unabe to confirm that there is no unintended behaviour. As I was unable to workout how to write this test, I did not make the game multiplayer as I would not be able to follow a TDD approach, and the added uncertainty would make adding Lizard and spock an issue as well. 

The app itself can be run via rackup and the the game can be played by visiting localhost:9292, and then following the instructions.
