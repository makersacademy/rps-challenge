# Makers Academy Week Three - Janken! (Rock/Paper/Scissors)
> 30 June - 01 July 2018

Third week (weekend) solo project, developing a 'rock/paper/scissors' game which allows the user to play against a computer opponent.

[Full project details and user stories here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge/blob/master/README.md)

## Completion

* All features & user stories fully implemented.
* All tests passing with 100% coverage.
* Code conforms to Rubocop style guide.

## Learning Outcomes

I made a concerted effort to carry out this challenge using feature and unit tests to inform the design. This methodical approach was successful, and I found the game relatively straightforward to implement. Used class methods from the beginning to track instances, which worked well and prevented my code from becoming cluttered. Also felt confident using doubles for the first time. I would have liked to spend some time working on the page design itself and improving the aesthetic quality of the game, but ran out of time.

## Technical

Ruby / HTML using Sinatra web framework with Rspec & Capybara for testing.

## Implementation

```shell
rackup config.ru
```
Visit 'localhost:9292' in browser.

## Further Improvements

* Some re-factoring needed.
* Implement multiplayer functionality.
* Expand to 'best of three' game system.
* Improve design using CSS and graphics.
