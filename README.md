# RPS

The application intends to reproduce the Rock,Paper,Scissors game against the computer in one hand only and declare a winner.
The application has been built using the Model–view–controller architectural pattern.
I have used Sinatra web framework and capybara ruby testing tool.
At this stage the application is still incomplete as the last user story (which is declaring a winner)is still missing. Also comments have been added to indicate the areas that I am exploring for changes.
The functionalities of the application are listed below:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

```
The below Hints on functionality have been used to model and create further user story, as the second user story above needed to be broken down further.

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared
