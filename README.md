# Rock, Paper, Scissors (Single Player)

I built this app during Week 3 of Makers Academy, following strict BDD and TDD principles (no code was written without a preceding test!)

At the time of writing, the randomness of the computer's selection isn't stubbed in the Cucumber tests. I hope to fix this shortly.
