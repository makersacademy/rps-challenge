# RPS Challenge

Instructions
-------

Rock Paper Scissors or Ching-Chong-Cha, as South African's call it, is a two player game. It requires you to call either rock, paper or scissors at the same time as your opponent. The winner is determined by the calls made by both participants.

Rules:
-------

- Rock beats scissors
- Paper beats rock
- Scissors beats paper


My Version:

The user will be playing against the computer and selecting a button which depends on the call they want to make (rock, paper or scissors).
