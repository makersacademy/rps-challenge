# RPS Challenge


This game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is run through a local web server and is a one player version.

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

The following user stories have been implemented, admittedly slightly lacking on the game aesthetics:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors

- Paper beats Rock

Launch the local web server by running 'ruby app.rb' through the terminal in the folllowing directory:
