## Reflections

In building the app, my main focuses were:
- Applying a strict red green refactor TDD approach
- Feature testing and unit testing to achieve comprehensive test coverage
- Use of MVC principles to achieve skinny controllers and views, with logic extracted to the model
- Using class instance variable to store my game's and players' state, and before filters, to elegantly pass objects between routes in the controller
- Applying the OOD principles from weeks 1 and 2

With unlimited time, there's a few things I would do to extend the application:
- Create an optional 2 player mode which players can select at the start of the game
- Upgrade the game to Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
- Create a score counter to keep track of the score
- I may implement these features in the coming weeks if I have time!

Key takeaways
- Understanding and applying MVC correctly feels like an important factor in successfully building an extendable web app
- CSS can be a slow process (at least when you're new to it!) But it's a great feeling when it all comes together
- It's been a week of building web apps and even though they've been fairly basic so far, it feels like great progress in 7 days
- Looking forward to learning how to build more sophisticated and impressive web apps! Bring on week 4
