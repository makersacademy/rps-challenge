# Rock-Paper-Scissors Challenge
## Charmander-Squirtle-Bulbasaur Implementation

Approach
-------
I've read the project walkthrough, initialised using
```rspec-sinatra init --app CSB lib/csb.rb```

Added following to spec_helper that was generated by the above code.
```require 'coveralls'
require 'simplecov'

SimpleCov.formatters = [
  SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
  Coveralls::SimpleCov::Formatter
]
Coveralls.wear!```

Now making my first commit.
