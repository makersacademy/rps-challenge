# RPS Challenge

Task
----

To build a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for Maker's marketing team, based on the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

### Functionality

- Player enters their name and game remembers it
- Player is presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- Player can choose one option
- The game chooses a random option for the computer
- Each player's choice is shown and a winner is declared
- Simple use of CSS for a nice user experience

### Further improvements

- I had intended to implement a "best of three" element to the game but ran out of time
- Build a multi-player option so two players can play against each other
