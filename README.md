RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock - RPS Challenge
==================

## Makers Week 3 Challenge
For my third weekend challenge at [Makers](https://www.makers.tech/) I was briefed to create a game as follows:

---

## Brief
The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
1
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

2
As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```


Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

### Bonus level 1: Multiplayer
### Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

## Running Tests

Run ```rspec```
This also handily displays the rules for the game:
```terminal
Game
  #winner
    scissors cuts paper
    paper covers rock
    rock crushes lizard
    lizard poisons spock
    spock smashes scissors
    scissors decapitates lizard
    lizard eats paper
    paper disproves spock
    spock vaporizes rock
    and as it always has, rock crushes scissors
```
