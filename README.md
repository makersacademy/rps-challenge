# Rock Paper Scissors Challenge

This is a rock, paper, scissors game web application, that allows you to play a single-player game.

## About
This is a weekend challenge from week 3 of the Maker's Academy course. The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) asked us to create a game, that they can play to take a break from their daily grind.

They provided the following user stories:

```bash
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
