# **Rock Paper Scissors challenge** #

My first web application that lets the Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) play the classic game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer. The user begins on the homepage and fills in their name. The next page will be a selection of weapons and once you've picked one, a results page will tell you what the computer has picked and whether you've won, lost or drew. Massive thanks to my girlfriend for design help and a logo that will be implemented later this week. The full game is available at:

## Outlook ##

* Study and undertand class methods
* Replace the global variables => **VERY BAD!!!**
* *Bonus level 1: Multiplayer* - Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).
* *Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard* - Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )
