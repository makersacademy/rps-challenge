# Overview
This program is intended to replicate the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors on the web.

Initially, the program was intended to facilitate a game between one player and a computerised opponent, however the specification has since been expanded to allow multiple players to play. Additionally, an alternative rendition to the game, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock has also been built into the program.
