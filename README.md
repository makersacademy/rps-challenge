# RPS Challenge

([Link to original README.md](/original-README.md))

This is a web app offering a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Written in Ruby using the Sinatra framework, with ERB for templating.

TDD/BDD with RSpec, using Capybara for BDD feature tests, and SimpleCov test coverage tool.

## Getting started

Either visit the live [Heroku-hosted version](https://quiet-wildwood-32600.herokuapp.com/), or `clone` and launch this web app locally:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dafuloth/rps-challenge.git

bundle

ruby app.rb

```

### Running the tests

After `bundle`, tests can be run with `rspec` or `rake spec`. Here is a screenshot of tests passing from the Travis CI build:

![Travis CI: tests passing](readme/tests-passing.png)

## My Approach

I use a TDD approach and I will start by looking at user stories so that I can write feature tests. In this case, user stories were provide so I did not have to write them myself. The feature tests are written from the perspective of the user. The user interacts with the application via their browser, so the feature tests are likewise front-end tests that test the application via the browser. 

As I begin to implement new classes to satisfy the feature test, I first write the unit tests for what I will be implementing.

There are many features that this Rock, Paper, Scissors game could support but I will not attempt to implement all of them, e.g. this game should ultimately allow two human players to play against each other, and perhaps give an option to play an expanded version of the game (["Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock)).

Instead, for my MVP I will begin by focusing on allowing a single player to play against the the computer

## Features

### Player registers their name before playing an online game

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

```

The feature test:

```ruby

feature 'Registering names' do
  scenario 'Player name displayed before playing an online game' do
    visit('/')
    fill_in :player_name, with: 'Winston'
    click_button 'Play'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Winston'
  end
end

```

### Player can play *rock, paper, scissors*

```sh

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

```
At this point it became clear that it would be a good idea to extract to a test helper the sign-in and clicking Play:

```ruby

def sign_in_and_play
  visit('/')
  fill_in :player_name, with: 'Winston'
  click_button 'Play'
end

```

These lines in `single_player_spec.rb` are replaced by calling the method `sign_in_and_play`. This method will be used in the gameplay feature tests for the outcomes of Win, Draw, and Loss.

```ruby

feature 'Playing the game' do
  scenario 'Player plays "Rock"' do
    sign_in_and_play
    click_on 'rock'
    expect(page).to have_content 'You chose "Rock"'
  end  

  scenario 'Player plays "Paper"' do
    sign_in_and_play
    click_on 'paper'
    expect(page).to have_content 'You chose "Paper"'
  end

  scenario 'Player plays "Scissors"' do
    sign_in_and_play
    click_on 'scissors'
    expect(page).to have_content 'You chose "Scissors"'
  end  

  scenario 'Player plays "Rock" and loses' do
    allow_any_instance_of(Array).to receive(:sample).and_return('paper')
    sign_in_and_play
    click_on 'rock'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Your opponent chose "Paper". You lose.'
  end

  scenario 'Player plays "Paper" and draws' do
    allow_any_instance_of(Array).to receive(:sample).and_return('paper')
    sign_in_and_play
    click_on 'paper'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Your opponent chose "Paper". It\'s a draw.'
  end

  scenario 'Player plays "Scissors" and wins' do
    allow_any_instance_of(Array).to receive(:sample).and_return('paper')
    sign_in_and_play
    click_on 'scissors'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Your opponent chose "Paper". You win!'
  end  
end


```


## Issues encountered

### Web app only renders correctly in Safari

_a.k.a. why it's often better to manually type a line of code instead of copying and pasting that line from the web_

#### `”` vs. `"`

Look closely at those two characters. I didn't see the difference at first but my browsers weren't so easily fooled.

In the end it was the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org) which allowed me to identify and resolve the issue.

I was writing [my CSS stylesheet](/public/css/styles.css) and could not remember how to link to it in my HTML. I looked up the line, copy & pasted the `type=”text/css”` part I was missing.

`<link rel="stylesheet" type=”text/css” href="/css/style.css" />`

It turns out that Safari is more forgiving because it rendered my HTML/CSS perfectly. Chrome and Firefox, not so much.

I even tried uploading my app to Heroku, in case there was something odd happening locally - but same thing. Arguably, it was Safari that rendered incorrectly: my incorrect code should not have resulted in a correct rendering. Firefox and Chrome did their jobs.

#### Unintentional feature: a.k.a. It's not a bug, it's a feature!
Because I used query strings instead of sessions for my data persistence, it's actually possible to play just by supplying the appropriate arguments:

https://quiet-wildwood-32600.herokuapp.com/result?player=Dave&choice=paper

If I wanted to change player name to _David_ and the choice to _rock_, I can just change it in the query string:

https://quiet-wildwood-32600.herokuapp.com/result?player=David&choice=rock

The obvious advantages of my approach is that it simpler and faster to use. Like, if you wanted to make a decision whether to do something, you could play a quick round of rock-paper-scissors with the computer - it'll return a different random result to every invocation.

- Some sites I looked at when I was centering an element: [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/), [Tipue](http://www.tipue.com/blog/center-a-div/)

- Rock, paper, scissors hand images modified from [this image](https://openclipart.org/detail/63805/rock-scissors-paper) from Openclipart contributor _mazeo_

- I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to make the separate Rock/Paper/Scissors images from the original SVG file

- I'm developing a preference for [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

## To Do

- Use sessions
- Either delete Player class or actually make use of it: it will be necessary when there is more than one human player but as the game is currently single-player against the computer, the Player class is not used.

## Addendum

- Added Travis CI so that I can add the badge showing that tests are passing
- Now working with a Ruby environment on Windows so Gemfile.lock that results from running `bundle` records platform as `x64-mingw32` which is incompatible with Travis CI. To fix this, I added the following to `.travis.yml`:

        before_install:
        - bundle lock --add-platform ruby
        - bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux

- Heroku set to auto-deploy after CI passing, so this push should trigger the deployment
