### Additional Things
I had a really tough time setting up Sinatra and the structure for the web app! The more complex structure also caused me some issues with debugging, with one particularly annoying glitch taking me a full two hours to resolve. This had quite a major effect on my time management, so as of my pull request there's very little game logic in the code. It's a bank holiday tomorrow so I'm going to aim to get the game fully functional and possibly even looking good with a bit of CSS before Tuesday. 

I'm quite happy that I managed to 'kill the global variable' by using class instance variables, and even though I'm not entirely happy with my rate of progress, I am satisfied that I managed to overcome a lot of bugs and roadblocks over the weekend I spent working on this!
