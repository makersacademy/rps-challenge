Task
----

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked you to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a ***Rock, Paper, Scissors*** game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality:

- The marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- The marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- The marketeer can choose one option
- The game will choose a random option
- A winner will be declared

Basic Rules:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

My Approach
------------
My aim was to create a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. Therefore I decided to keep the features and design of this program as simple and elegant as possible. I first designed the class objects:

* [Game](https://github.com/hsheikhm/rps-challenge/blob/master/lib/game.rb) (holds the weapons and game rules)
* [Computer](https://github.com/hsheikhm/rps-challenge/blob/master/lib/computer.rb) (gives the computer a random weapon)
* [Player](https://github.com/hsheikhm/rps-challenge/blob/master/lib/player.rb) (for the user to sign up and choose a weapon)


After having completed the **RSpec** [testing](https://github.com/hsheikhm/rps-challenge/tree/master/spec) for the above classes I then moved onto web app side of things and therefore used **Sinatra** and **Capybara** to build and test the main features. In order to achieve the ***separation of concerns*** I made sure to keep my [controller](https://github.com/hsheikhm/rps-challenge/blob/master/rps_web.rb) *skinny* so that it didn't have too many responsibilities. Instead of using global variables I also used the handy Sinatra *helper methods*.

Once all the features of the web app had been tested and implemented it was then just a case of applying styling to the app through [HTML](https://github.com/hsheikhm/rps-challenge/tree/master/views) and [CSS](https://github.com/hsheikhm/rps-challenge/blob/master/public/css/application.css).
