So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind

# Functionality #

- The marketeer is able to enter their name before the game
- The marketeer is presented with weapon choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- The marketeer can choose one weapon
- The game will choose a random weapon
- A winner is declared

With more time I would like to refactor the code and add multiplayer functionality.
