##### Makersacademy Week3 - RPS Challenge

### Multi-browser Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock ###
Multi-browser Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock ( MB-RPSLS ) enables you to play RPSLS game with an opponent simultaneously in separate browsers - locally or remotely that is!

### Installation
#### Local play :
1. Fork this repo
2. Copy the URL of the forked repo
3. Fire up terminal ( or equivalent ) and move to the desired directory, in which you want to create a clone of MB-RPSLS
4. Clone the forked repo: ```$ git clone URL```
5. Rub bundle to install relevant gems: ```$ bundle```
6. Run the programme: ```$ ruby mb_rpsls.rb```
7. Check the port number in the terminal output. In the example below, it is *port=4567*
8. Open a preferred browser and type ```localhost:port number``` into the URL bar. ( e.g. ```localhost:4567``` if port number is 4567 )
9. You should be redirected to the title page

Example of terminal output upon running the application:
```

2. P1 and P2 click **Entry**
3. Choose player
4. Players enter their names and click **Complete entry** ( if no name is given, it assigns 'Anon' by default )
5. The page will wait until both players complete entry ( it will result in an internal server error if both players don't complete entry after a certain time )
6. P1 and P2 click respective **Play game**
7. Players are presented with **5 choices** - choose one
8. The page displays the result of the round, once both players make their choices

### Development
MB-RPSLS is written in Ruby 2.2.3 and has been developed using Sinatra 1.4.7 ( https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra ). It uses RSpec 3.2.2 as a platform for behaviour-driven development (BDD) in conjunction with Capybara 2.6.2 ( https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#using-capybara-with-rspec ) as an acceptance test framework. The continuous integration is assessed through Travis-CI with the latest test coverage of 100%. Online version is supported by a cloud application platform Heroku ( https://www.heroku.com/ ).
