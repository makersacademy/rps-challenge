As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

# About

This web app allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer in two modes: "Classic" and "Special". "Special" is Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard.

I built the app using two classes: player and game.

It embodies the timeless stylings of MS-DOS.

Test coverage = 100%

To do list:

Test all permutations of the "Special" game-type (although confident it performs as desired, uses same hash and method as classic which is fully tested.)
