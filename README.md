# RPS Challenge

Description
-------

* Solution to the Makers Academy weekend challenge.
* I did not manage to get the travis badge in this README.
* The screens are very basic, but functional.

Requirements
----

The challenge is based on the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
Approach
----

* Write a draft of this approach, so that I don't rush into development!
* Create a basic working environment based on a simple feature test.
  * Bundle; Pull request; first commit
  * Configure rspec (no examples), rack config, coverage tool.
  * Create feature test for "Hello Player!" and get to pass.
* Read the use cases carefully, so that I don't miss anything.
* Create a sketch of the screens and classes (see below)
* Implement the use cases, following a red, green, refactor approach

 Testing

The tests can be run using the command rspec
