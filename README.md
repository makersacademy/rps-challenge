A [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_) game built using the Sinatra framework, RSpec and Capybara. A demo is available at https://rpslizardspock.herokuapp.com/.

The game addresses the following user stories:
```sh
As a player
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a player
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors/lizard/spock
