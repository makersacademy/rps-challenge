The RPS (Rock, Paper, Scissors) challenge is a 'Friday Challenge' set to try and test your knowledge of 'modelling some protocols used by computers to communicate across the Web'.

## Description
The program should initially ask the player for their name, and then allow them to select their play. This should be either Rock, Paper or Scissors. The game should work out the correct output depending on the user input. The rules are as follows:
```
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
```
## Installation
You will need to install bundle.

## Roadmap
A future release may include the functionality of multiplayer. It may also be improved to allow the player to play the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock".

## Project status
This project is complete in terms of the required functionality. However, I am still working on adding in the multiplayer feature as a mode for the player to choose, so I am able to keep the cpu mode as well. Thed pull request does not include my current progress in this. I will push my work to the pull request on completion.
