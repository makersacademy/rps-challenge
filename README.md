To play the advanced rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock, select this option and click 'Change mode'.
You can see that the mode changed since the title is changing

### Players
To play against the computer, enter your name and then click 'Start game against computer'.  

To play against another human, enter your name and then click 'Add another human player'. A new page opens where the second player can enter their name. It then moves on to the next page where the first player can enter their move.

### Play again
Once both players have made their moves, you can see who has won or whether it's a draw. You then have two options:  
1. You can play the same game again ('Play again'), which leads you back to a page where player 1 can enter their move. Mode and player names are saved.  
2. You can start a complete new game with user names and mode set to default again.
