# RPS Challenge

Approach
-------

* This challenge was done in a test-driven manner, using RSpec, and capybara. The bulk of the code was written using Ruby, and the remainder HTML.
* The "mechanics" of this deeply complex game were done in a Game class, which would store the names of the players, and calculate the winners of each round.
* You have the choice of playing 1 or 2 player, although expect mildly sarcastic remarks about your loneliness if you choose to play on your own.
* Because the base game of rock paper scissors wasn't thrilling enough, lizard and space nerd(spock) were added to "spice things up a bit".
* If someone were to force me to work on this thrilling project longer, I would have spent more time on the layout of the website, and also spent some time refactoring the logic of the Game class, however, I didn't want to, so here we are!
