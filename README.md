I missed the first half of the week, which happened to introduce Sinatra, Capybara, HTML, CSS and Heroku into the mix. 
This has set me back quite a bit. 

I've got a functioning Rock, Paper, Scissors game in irb (which I struggled with for a while - I forgot that case statements
depend on booleans just like if/else statements, and my "whens" were not equating to true/false)

I have a welcome page built, a page where one can enter their username and a page where that user can select from a dropdown menu of what their 'weapon of choice'

working with sessions and the latter part of Week 3 went over my head, and I hope to figure this out and complete this challenge.
