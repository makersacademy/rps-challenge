# RPS Challenge

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## TO IMPROVE

- DRY
- SRP
- turn class is a bit clumsy and could be turned into seperate classes such as player / game / computer

## NEED FURTHER UNDERSTANDING
- path between get and post requests.
- understanding when to keep the code within the controller (app-rsp.rb) or create a class file.
- creating class and process diagrams
- CSS for design elements
