# RPS Challenge

This is a solution to Makers Academy's [RPS Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge). This creates a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) application for the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game. This uses a test-driven approach with both unit tests using [RSpec](http://rspec.info) and feature tests using [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara).
