# Week 3 Project : Rock Paper Scissors Game

This challenge requires me to build 'rock paper scissors' game application using the user story below:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Game Basic Rules
```
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
```

My project is organised in the following folders:
- RSpec tests =>  /spec
- Capybara tests =>  spec/features
- Ruby scripts => lib
- HTMl pages => lib/views


The game I have built can be found on Heroku:
[Play Rock-Scissors-Paper]()
