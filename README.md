## Usage

I'm not going to bother explaining the rules, if you for wheterver reason don't know the rules of Rock Paper Scissors you can view them [here](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html)
To begin enter at least one name, if no second name is entered the program will assign you your very own computerised opponent, however entering two names will allow for multiplay. the rules are first to five points, once 5 points is reached a new game can then be started if you so desire to play again.
