This is the Weekend Challenge for Makers Academy Week 3 â€“ Rock, Paper, Scissors.

This program aims to satisfy the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

It plays the user's choice against a computer that has random behaviour, with the following rules:

- Rock beats Scissors & Lizard
- Scissors beats Paper & Lizard
- Lizard beats Paper & Spock
- Paper beats Rock & Spock
- Spock beats Rock & Scissors

In order to play, visit https://pacific-thicket-98080.herokuapp.com/

At the moment, the results of the game are incorrect, but any modifications can be made by cloning this repo
```git clone```
and running `bundle` to install all necessary gems.

By typing `ruby app.rb` into the command-line, you will start up Sinatra, which will make the program accessible via your browser when you type `localhost:4567` into the address bar.
