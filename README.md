#**Paper Scissors Rock**

##*Introduction*

The aim of this weeks challenge is to create an online version of the paper scissors rock game. I in tend to focus on MVP this week, but publishing as soon as possible each component and then refectoring as the complexities arise.

###*Installation*

The program uses the following:
- version 2.2.3 of Ruby
- capybara
- sinatra 1.4.6

To play the game please do the following:
```ruby
$ git clone https://github.com/rochester234/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle
$ rackup
```
