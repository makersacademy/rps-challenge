Task
---

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

What I did
---
I started this task by building the back-end of the game first. I unit-tested it and made sure it worked in Pry before thinking about the controller or front-end.

This helped me a lot when thinking about whether to use GET or POST.

To do
---
Sadly never got as far as implementing multi-player or Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, although I think the latter could be included easily enough. I need to remove the hard-coding of the result string from Game class. It is messy and limits what I can do with [/result](/result).

Got to play around a little with Bootstrap. I know I could do a lot more, just need time!
