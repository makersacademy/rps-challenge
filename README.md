This is my final submission for the Makers Academy Week 3 Challenge

# RPS Challenge

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

### Start

To start the program run rackup in the terminal in the root folder:
```
rackup
```
Then open your broswer and enter the url:
```
localhost:9292
```
You will then be asked for your name on the hompage. Once you enter it you can then select from two game types

### Rock Paper Scissors
Chose from either rock paper or scissors. The computer will ramdomly chose an option and the winner will be ammounced on the results page. The results page also tracks the current score in that session and allows you to take another turn by clicking on the Play again button. If you want to restart the session then click Restart which will take you back to the homepage. This resets the current score back to 0-0.

### Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
This is the same as Rock Paper Scissors game with two additional choices. The rules on winning are explained at the bottom of the page.
