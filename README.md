Start by going to the /name route.

Initially planned to make a class for 'player' and a class for 'shape' but ended up seeming a very bloated way to implement what can just be strings?

I don't like my winner_calculator method - seems like a too-complex if statement and would like to refactor.

Additional functionality would like to build:
* 'Play again' button
* Multiplayer

* Question: why does a 'expect(page).to have_content' test sometimes give a false positive?
