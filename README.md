# RPS Challenge: Rōnin Badge Test

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```


Notes:

The main challenges while creating this application were applying the new skills I had learned earlier that week to a completely new task. I spent a lot of time revising previous concepts and reminding myself of definitions. I found this incredibly helpful in giving me a better understanding of the web framework.

The app I have built aims to follow the user stories while remaining as simple as possible. It fulfills its function as a game of rock paper scissors, and would be easy to build upon in the future.
