# RPS Challenge

**Try it out here: https://peters-rock-paper-scissors.herokuapp.com/**

## How to run
```ruby
ruby app.rb
```

## Notes
* Based on the instructions here: https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge
* Test-driven using RSpec with Capybara. Test coverage is 100%
* Didn't get time to implement the stretch features, but app is set up with them in mind so it wouldn't be too hard to do so.
