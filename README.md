Running the site locally
-------
run `bundle` to acquire the relevant gems.<br/>

Open a terminal and run `rackup`.  This usually settles on `port 9292`, though you can append `-p [NUMBER]` to choose your own â€“ for instance:
```
$ rackup -p 4567
```

once the local server is running, open the site in your browser.  For `port 9292` you would need:
```
http://localhost:9292
```
All should be in order!
