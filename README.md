# RPS Challenge

To play the RPS game, you need to register your name.
Once you sign up, you can play with either computer or your friends.

You choose one of the options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Then press the "play" button. Then it will tell you whether you win or lose.

When you play with your friends, you both have to register your name. If you choose one of the options before your friend, it will tell you to wait for your friend. Once your friend chooses an option, you can click the link (see the result) to see whether you win or not.

You can play game as many times as you want by clicking the "play again" button.

Enjoy the game!
