# RPS Challenge

Task
----
This challenge was given to us as our third weekend challenge at Makers Academy. It enabled me to practice building simple web applications and follow an effective debugging process for web applications. I managed to successfully complete all the User Stories but if given more time I would like to practice with CSS and HTML to style the game better. The instructions were as follows:

"Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## Steps to run this program

1. Clone this repo
2. Run 'gem install bundle'
3. When the installation completes, run 'bundle'
4. From the command line, run ```ruby app.rb``` and visit 'http://localhost:4567'

## Skills I used / learnt

* How to debug a web app
* Using a framework (Sinatra) which is something I have not done yet
* Structuring the code for apps that have user interaction and visual output
* Testing apps that have user interaction and visual output
* Tracing data between the browser and server

## What I would like to improve/fix

If I spent more time on this challenge I would like to:
* Implement multi-player mode so that the user does not have to play against the computer
* Refactor some elements of my code I am not happy with, such as the long conditional statement. Instead I would use a hash to map over the rules of the game
* Improve the visual output
