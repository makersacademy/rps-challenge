# Rock Paper Scissors (Lizard Spock)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hturnbull93/rps-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hturnbull93/rps-challenge)

[Source](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge)

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

## User Stories

> As a marketeer  
> So that I can see my name in lights  
> I would like to register my name before playing an online game

> As a marketeer  
> So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind  
> I would like to be able to play Rock/Paper/Scissors

## Technical requirements

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (Rock, Paper and Scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared
- Test driven with all tests passing and high test coverage

Advanced:

- Multi-player - Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).
- Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock - Use the [_special_ rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock).

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## Instructions

### Setup

- From the root directory install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  bundle
  ```

### Running the Server

- From the root directory run the server:

  ```bash
  rackup
  ```

### Playing a Game

- Head in your browser to <http://localhost:9292/>

- Follow the onscreen instructions.

### Development approach

I approached this project using Test Driven Development strategies:

- Only write the most basic test you need to fail.
- Only write production code to pass a failing test.
- Only write the most basic production code to pass the test.

I approached this project with object oriented programming in mind:

- Objects should encapsulate methods that are related to one another in purpose.
- Methods should have a single responsibility, so they do not do too much, and are concise.

In order to keep code clear and readable, I used rubocop for linting.

### Domain Modelling

I wrote a short domain model diagram in order to organise my thoughts on the user stories.

| Objects     | Messages                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Marketeer   |                                     |
| Online Game | Name, Rock, Paper, Scissors, winner |

There aren't very many so I will need to rely on good TDD to drive the behaviour out of the tests.

### User Story 1

> As a marketeer  
> So that I can see my name in lights  
> I would like to register my name before playing an online game

First some set up, configured spec_helper.rb to require app.rb and set the capybara app to Rps.

- Wrote a small Hello World test to make sure the testing is configured correctly. Test Red.

- Added app.rb with Rps inheriting Sinatra::Base.

- Added a route for '/' returning "Hello World". Test Green.

Also added config.ru to be able to rackup for manual testing.

When the marketeer visits the site, there needs to be a field in order to enter their name, and their name should be displayed.

Wrote a feature test using capybara, that when visiting / and entering Dave into the name field and submitting the form, Dave is displayed on the page. Test red.

- Updated get / to return an view, index.erb (in the views dir)

- In index.erb added a form to enter name and submit, posting to /play

- In app.rb added a post /play route, hardcoded to return 'Dave'. Test green.

Wrote a feature test entering the name Jim. Test red.

- In post /play instead returned the name parameter of the query string. Test green.

#### Refactoring 1

- Enabled sessions

- Changed post /play to add the params to the session hash.

- Added redirect to get /play, where an instance variable is set with the key in the session hash, and displayed in a view: play.erb.

- Removed the now useless Hello World test.

All tests still green.

### User Story 2

> As a marketeer  
> So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind  
> I would like to be able to play Rock/Paper/Scissors

This is quite a jump forward. Breaking it down:

### User Story 2.1

> As a marketeer  
> So that I can play a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors
> I would like to be able to choose which to use Rock/Paper/Scissors

This is more manageable.

Wrote a feature test for Dave to choose Rock and see Dave: Rock. Test red.

- Added button for Rock to submit and post to /result.

- Added route for post /result to display 'Dave: Rock'.

Test Green.

Wrote a feature test for Dave to choose Paper and see Dave: Paper. Test red.

- Added button for Paper to submit and post to /result.

- Changed post /result to display the choice made from the parameters, Dave still hardcoded.

Test Green.

Wrote a feature test for Jim to choose Scissors and see Jim: Scissors. Test red.

- Added button for Scissors to submit and post to /result.

- Changed post /result to display the name held in session.

#### Refactoring 2.1

- Rather than outputting an interpolated string, added the choice to the session hash. and redirected to get /result

- Added route for get /result assigning instance variables name and choice, and returning view result.erb

- Extracted the lengthy enter name process to helper methods in web_helpers.rb and required this in the spec_helper file.

Tests still green.

### User Story 2.2

> As a marketeer  
> So that I can play a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors
> I would like to see my computer opponent's choice

Right now the controller (app.rb) is simply returning back user inputs to the view.

In order to play a game vs a computer opponent there needs to be a logic that makes the computer choose an option.

Wrote a feature test for Dave to choose Rock and the computer to choose Rock, expect to see 'Computer: Rock'. Test red.

- Hardcoded 'Computer: Rock' in the result view.

Test green.

Wrote a feature test for Dave to choose Rock and the computer to choose Paper, expect to see 'Computer: Paper'. Test red.

- In post /result added a new key to session, comp_choice, and assigned that by sampling an array containing 'Rock' and 'Paper'.

- Added a new instance variable for comp_choice in get /result, and altered the result view to properly display this

- Needed to control the randomness in the tests so used srand to make sure they behave consistently.

Test green.

Wrote a feature test for Dave to choose Rock and the computer to choose Scissors, expect to see 'Computer: Scissors'. Test red.

- Added 'Scissors' to the sampled array.

- Added an appropriate srand to the test to control randomness.

Test green.

### User Stories 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5

> As a marketeer  
> So that I can draw a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors
> I would like to see that we draw if my choice matches the computer's choice

> As a marketeer  
> So that I can win a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors
> I would like to see that I win if my choice beats the computer's choice

> As a marketeer  
> So that I can lose a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors
> I would like to see that the computer wins if my choice loses to the computer's choice

Before going any further the logic should probably be extracted to a model at this point.

#### Refactoring to a Model

Wrote tests for a Player class constructed with the name of the player. Test red.

- Added a lib dir, added player.rb

- Player constructs with name as parameter, assigned to @name.

- Added attr_reader for @name.

Test green.

Wrote test that #choose sets the the choice attribute. Test red.

- Wrote custom setter #choose to set @choice.

- Added attr_reader for @choice.

Test green.

Wrote tests for a Comp class, #name to return 'Computer'. Test red.

- Added comp.rb to lib.

- Comp constructs with @name always assigned as 'Computer'.

- Added attr_reader for @name.

Test green.

Wrote tests that #choice attribute can be Rock, Paper or Scissors randomly. Test red.

- Wrote @choice to be initialised with a sample of the Rock Paper Scissors array form app.rb.

- Added attr_reader for @choice.

- Added appropriate srands to control randomness in tests.

Test green.

Wrote tests for a Game class constructed with the name of the player, player_class defaulting to Player, comp_class defaulting to Comp (allows dependency injection for testing).

The tests center around #winner, which returns either the player or comp instances, or nil if it is a draw.

Wrote a suite of tests for each scenario of RPS. Tests red.

- Wrote some logic in a method #decide_winner, a series of guarded clauses checking @player and @comp choices and assigning @winner with either @player or @comp  

- Exposed @winner with an attr_reader

Tests green.

Extracted three helper methods from #decide_winner (#player_chose_rock, #player_chose_paper, #player_chose_scissors). Each contains the logic to assign winner based on @comp.choice. #decide_winner contains a switch statement to call a helper method based on @player.choice.

_There must be a better way that this logic, but I'm going to keep going as it works and isn't too bad._

### Refactoring Controller to use Model

In order for the view to show the winner or a draw, the controller needs to use the model.

Wrote a feature test where Dave chooses Rock, and so does the computer, expecting there to be 'Draw' displayed, stubbing instances of Comp #choice to return Rock. Test red.

- Updated the result view to include the word Draw hardcoded

Test green.

Wrote a feature test for Dave to choose Rock and the computer to choose Paper, expecting there to be 'Computer wins' displayed, stubbing instances of Comp #choice to return Paper. Test red.

- Added a new Class method to Game, #create, which stores that game as a Class variable, so it can be accessed across HTTP requests, and a custom getter for the Class variable, #instance.

- Replaced logic in app.rb to instantiate a game and use that instead of session, each route now using Game.instance to assign instance variables.

Test green.

#### Refactoring Controller and Views to use Model well

- Views erb tags use @game and method calls to get values for names and choices.

- Created an instance variable @game assigned with Game.instance in a before block so to DRY up routes.

### Advanced Requirement: Multi-player

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other.

Wrote a feature test for Dave and Jim to enter their names then see 'Dave vs Jim'. Test red.

- Reworked Game to be able to accept two player name inputs, if only one is given player 2 is constructed as a Comp instance.

- Created a new form on index.erb for multi-player, also reworked the original form to be titled single-player.

- Replaced instances of 'Computer' in the views to use player 2's name (which would be computer if a comp replaces player 2)

Test green.

Wrote a feature test for Dave and Jim to enter their names then see 'Dave's choice. No peeking Jim!'. Test red.

- Added #multiplayer? to Game, returning true if second player is not a comp.

- Added conditional to play.erb to display hardcoded string if #multiplayer? true.

Test green.

Wrote a feature test for Dave and Jim to enter their names, Dave to choose rock, then to see 'Jim's choice. No peeking Dave!'. Test red.

- Added executive ruby statement to play erb to show a different hardcoded string.

- Added to app.rb after posting this form to go back to play and display a different hardcoded string in play.erb with executive ruby statement.

Test green.

Wrote a feature test for Pete and Steve to enter their names then see 'Pete's choice. No peeking Steve!'. Test red.

- Updated hardcoded string to use player names.

Test green.

Wrote a feature test for Pete and Steve to enter their names, Pete to choose Rock, then to see 'Steve's choice. No peeking Pete!'. Test red.

- Updated hardcoded string to use player names.

Wrote a feature test for Dave and Jim to enter their names, Dave choose rock,, Jim choose Rock, see Draw. Test red.

- Added another form for player 2 to select their choice.

- Added routes for player 2's choice post request and redirected to /results.

Test green.

To double check, wrote a feature test for Dave and Jim to enter their names, Dave choose Rock,, Jim choose Paper, see Jim wins. Test green (phew).

#### Refactoring Multi-player

- Created a method in game #player_1_turn? to clean up the logic of checking which form to display in play.erb

- Refactored routing to reuse existing routes and redirect based on if statements (i.e. if game multiplayer, loop back to play to get player 2's choice).

- Simplified play.erb to use only 1 form. executive ruby changes headers and the form action based on the multiplayer player turn.

Tests still green.

### Advanced Requirement: Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Here are the rules as a diagram:

![Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](/images/RPSLS.jpeg)

And a table:

| Thing    | Beats               | Loses to            |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Rock     | Scissors and Lizard | Paper and Spock     |
| Paper    | Rock and Spock      | Scissors and Lizard |
| Scissors | Paper and Lizard    | Rock and Spock      |
| Lizard   | Paper and Spock     | Rock and Scissors   |
| Spock    | Rock and Scissors   | Paper and Lizard    |

Wrote a feature test to be able to choose Lizard and see that player chose Lizard. Test red.

- Added button for Lizard.

Test green.

Wrote a feature test to be able to choose Spock and see that player chose Spock. Test red.

- Added button for Spock.

Test green.

Wrote a unit test for comp to be able to choose Lizard. Test red.

- Added 'Lizard' to sample array for comp choice.

- Fiddled with srand to control randomness

Test green.

Wrote a unit test for comp to be able to choose Spock. Test red.

- Added 'Spock' to sample array for comp choice.

- Fiddled with srand to control randomness

Test green.

Wrote a feature test for Dave chooses Lizard and comp chooses Spock, Dave wins. Test red.

- Wrote unit tests for all combos. Tests red.

- Replaced logic in #decide_winner use a positional relationship between player 1's choice and player 2's choice. If player 2 is one ahead or 2 behind player 1, player 1 wins.

- General solution works. Unit tests green.

Test green.

#### Refactoring Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

- Removed winner attributed and changed #decide_winner to #winner, returning the winner. There was no need these to be set and accessed separately.

### Adding Style

The current views are rendered as regular unstyled HTML, which doesn't look very nice.

- Borrowed the css from the [Birthday Greeter App](https://github.com/hturnbull93/birthday-greeter-app) I made.

- Swapped results page ':'s for "chose", which is friendlier (tweaked tests that included that text).

- Styled it all up, added FontAwesome icons.

## Reflections

I feel that I have done quite well sticking to TDD during this project. 100% of tests pass with 100% coverage.

I tried only to make changes to pass tests (excluding styling with css, which I consider refactoring as it does not change the functionality).

I feel that I observed OO principles reasonably well, flog scores are good.

I'm quite pleased with my solution to determine the winner too.
