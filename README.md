# RPS Challenge

Play a Russell-Crowe themed game of Rock Paper Scissors. The Gladiator is asked for their name and choice of weapon. Once submitted, they will enter the colosseum and know their destiny. Of course, there is the option to go back and try again.

My feature tests are lacking. Reading needed on Srand. 

Through this challenge, my birthday calculator and the Battle work, I've built my understanding of the MVC relationship. These tasks have particularly shown me the importance of having a 'skinny controller' - separate the logic and make it readable.

Lots to learn here. Looking forward to introducing databases.
