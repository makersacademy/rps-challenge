RPS Challenge
=============

This challenge was forked from [Makers Academy RPS Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge).
The user stories were as follows:
```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
To meet these requirements I created a web application that allows a user to enter their name, choose their hand and see the result of playing their hand against that randomly generated by the computer. I used the `rspec-sintra` gem to build the web app, and the `rspec` and `capybara` gems for testing the code, in accordance with the principles of TDD.
