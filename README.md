# RPS Challenge

I didn't get to spend as much time on this challenge as previous weekends.

I was able to apply all knowledge I learnt this week, and was pleased to use class instance variables correctly, as well as params.

I got stuck on the final piece - how to get the Game class to calculate the winner and for play.erb to retrieve this. I suspect it has something to do with where game.play is being called and then how this information gets passed to play.erb.

This week, I would like to practice debugging with Sinatra more.
