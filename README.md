TO DO
-----
*   Symbols a better choice than strings for game choices.

    Scenario: Ending the game and starting over
    Given I am on the game over page
    Then I should see "Game Over"
    When I follow "Play Again?"
    Then I should see "Enter your name"
    (http://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html- Testing Sinatra with Rack::Test / 'seed' function required?)
*   Two player mode.
*   Add styling to submit button (larger).

N.B.
