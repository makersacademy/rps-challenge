About
-------

This Rock, Paper, Scissors app has been built using Ruby and Sinatra.

The app allows a single user to 'log-in' by entering their name, then selecting rock, paper, or scissors. The computer opponent chooses their attack, and a winner is declared. The user can play multiple times, with a running score appearing on the results screen.

Installation Instructions
-------

```
$ git clone git@github.com:iammatthewward/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle
```

User Instructions
-------
The app can be served by typing `ruby app.rb` in the command line, from within the root directory. It is also deployed to [Heroku](https://guarded-brushlands-24541.herokuapp.com/) and can be interacted with there live.
