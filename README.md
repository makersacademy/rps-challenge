# RPS Challenge

Our third weekend challenge required us to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors web app that allowed a user to play against the computer. The user would select their utility of choice, whilst the computers will be randomly generated.

- Had to use knowledge of Object Oriented Programming to allow classes to interact
- Used the MVC pattern to create the web app itself
- required the use of GET and POST requests

## Tests ##

Tests are made using the rspec ruby gem and capybara gem. 

First install rspec by running this in your terminal: 'gem install rspec'  

Run 'rspec' in your terminal when inside the 'RPS' directory to use them.
