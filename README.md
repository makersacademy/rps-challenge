This is my attempt at the Makers Academy Rock Paper Scissors webapp challenge.

Here is the task description:

```
Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game to play on the web with the following user stories:

As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

Hints on functionality:

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared
```
