An unfinished attempt at Rock, Paper, Scissors. Had a go at getting rid of  global variables from the very start and ran into a seemingly trivial issue of the form not assigning the needed instance variable 'name' on submit. Googled and pixel-peeped through all its aspects for several hours to no avail. No user stories finished, no game logic implemented. Feeling extremely frustrated and disappointed with myself over what looked like a straightforward challenge.

UPD: Fixed that with a fresh pair of my pair's eyes today. Was a most trivial thing! Feel a bit better now, but still lots of time wasted? and the logic is not finished.
