# RPS Challenge

In the command line, type in:

bundle or bundle install

rackup -p 4567 config.ru

In your browser:

open this URL: http://localhost:4567/ 

I had looked up Sharon Briscoe's solution when I found that the app.rb had trouble finding the @players array from the Game class. I then decided to use sessions methods.
