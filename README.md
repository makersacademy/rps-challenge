# Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge #

Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors. The classic game of strategy, class and a little bit of *luck*. 

For ease of use, everything has been designed to be as user friendly as possible (*lots of buttons*)

To load the game up, first ensure you have a cloned version of the code. Once you have this navigate to the folder in question

```
$ cd some/folder/with/rps/in/it
```

From here you can use ```rackup``` in the console. you should get a bunch of computer stuff (technical I know) load up, but the most important bit is the port number. By taking the port number and searching ```localhost:*port number*``` the game should load for your enjoyment! 

Once loaded, give the computer your name and be ready to be amazed as you dive into the competative world of human vs machine! You'll not believe just how much fun you can have...*maybe*
