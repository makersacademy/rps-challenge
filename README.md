Learnings:

This challenge has helped me work towards the learning objectives for week 3 at Makers.
1. Build a simple web app
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications

I would have like to complete the bonus levels and also been able to refactor the code
further. I would have also wanted to add more specified tests for each feature.

In this README I would have liked to add screenshots of the game and tests.
