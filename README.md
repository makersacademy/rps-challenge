This is Rock, Paper, Scissors. If you are unsure of the rules of this game, climb out of your rock and simply google it.

Hope you enjoy.

If you would like to play my RPS, clone my repo down, go in the command line and type 'ruby app.rb'. Then in your browser type 'localhost:4567/'. That should work. 

My logic:

A user goes to the Rock, Paper, Scissor (RPS) homepage and is allowed to input their name. This redirects them to the play page where they can make their selection. Once they make a selection, they're redirected to the results page if there's a winner or the tie page if it's a tie. With either page, they can replay the game which will keep the same user but take them back to the play page to play another game. After a win, with either a computer or user win, they can also restart the game which brings them to the login screen. I have two classes, a Game class and a Player class. I started going down the path of making it so it would be a two player game but decided it was just a little too much right now. I don't think it would take too much more with the way that my Game and Player classes are set up. It's more of how to get the same site on different browsers and how my app.rb would be set up.

This is where screenshots would go if I made any:
