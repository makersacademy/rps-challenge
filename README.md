# Rock Paper Scissors Challenge

### [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com) - Week 2 Pair Programming Project

## Outline
This game allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer. The user to able to enter their name and choose their move (rock, paper or scissors) before comparing it to the computer's randomly choosen move and a winner is declared. 

## The Task
I used this project to learn more about Sinatra, building basic web applications and HTML tags. I also practiced writing Capybara tests and thought about UI/UX design as I was planning the layout of the program. This project has inspired me to learn more about CSS, Bootstrap and more advanced HTML functionalities.
