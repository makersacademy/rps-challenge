WELCOME TO ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!

This is a very basic app that lets you play the game rock, paper, scissors either multi or single player.

To play the app do the following

 - clone this repository
 - run 'bundle install' in the terminal
 - run 'ruby app.rb' in the terminal
 - open your browser and check localhost:4567 (or whatever port you choose)

 The rules are simple,

 Rock smashes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock

 I hope you enjoy the game,
