# RPS Challenge

Task
----

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

To use
------

```
git clone git@github.com:tobold/rps-challenge.git
bundle
rackup
```

or alternatively, use my Heroku app: https://tobold-rps.herokuapp.com/
