# RPS Challenge

How to use this webapp
---------

```
$ git clone git@github.com:scass91/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle
$ rackup
The app should now be available in your browser at localhost:9292
```

My approach to this challenge
---------
* Use user stories to build file structure and think about how I want them to interact with one another
* Build a test for a method I want, let it fail, then write the code and rework until it passes - using the TDD process learned in week 1 at Makers Academy
* Two items were present in the user stories - Game & Player
* Used the user stories info to build these classes, for example the player had the ability to select a random attack from R/P/S
* Ran feature tests every step along the way to make sure the code was doing what I wanted it to be doing, and the tests weren't just passing by accident
* Effectively used the given tests to gain 0 rubocop infractions & 100% test coverage
* One of my favourite TV shows makes an appearance in the video at the start!

An example of how the program can be run in irb
---------

```
Simons-MBP:~ simon$ cd projects
Simons-MBP:projects simon$ cd rps-challenge/
Simons-MBP:rps-challenge simon$ irb
2.5.0 :001 > require "./app.rb"
 => true
2.5.0 :002 > p1 = Player.new("Simon","rock")
 => #<Player:0x00007fc6702b8660 @name="Simon", @options="rock">
2.5.0 :003 > p2 = Player.new("Computer","scissors")
 => #<Player:0x00007fc6702e0480 @name="Computer", @options="scissors">
2.5.0 :004 > g = Game.new(p1,p2)
 => #<Game:0x00007fc6708a4a10 @player_1=#<Player:0x00007fc6702b8660 @name="Simon", @options="rock">, @player_2=#<Player:0x00007fc6702e0480 @name="Computer", @options="scissors">>
2.5.0 :005 > g.result
 => "Simon wins!"
```

Future direction
---------
* Implement full multiplayer functionality
* Implement further weapons in the form of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
* Improve how the app looks by adding more graphics/CSS styling
* Add a scoreboard tracker to keep count of current score when multiple matches are played, i.e. implement a best of 3 scenario

Instructions
-------

* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared


As usual please start by

* Forking this repo
* TEST driving development of your app


## Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

## Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this at this moment.

Notes on test coverage
----------------------

Please ensure you have the following **AT THE TOP** of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
require 'simplecov-console'

SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
  SimpleCov::Formatter::Console,
  # Want a nice code coverage website? Uncomment this next line!
  # SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter
])
SimpleCov.start
```

You can see your test coverage when you run your tests. If you want this in a graphical form, uncomment the `HTMLFormatter` line and see what happens!
