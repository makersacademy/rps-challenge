# RPS Challenge: R≈çnin Badge Test

Welcome to RPS, an exciting, futuristic reimagining of the barbers' favourite, Rock, Paper, Scissors.

To get a taste of the future, clone this repo to your machine. Then from the terminal, type:

$ bundle

To download all dependencies. Then type:

$ ruby app.rb

To run the app.

You can then enjoy a challenging game of wit, skullduggery and skill against the computer or a friend* by pointing your browser at:

http://localhost:4567/

Enter your name (you can skip this step if you have played before - as the system will REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE. This may seem spooky, but it is actually simple computer wizardry. Another upside is that, should you not go too hard on your automated opponent, our computer overlords might spare you during the post- singularity cleansing).
