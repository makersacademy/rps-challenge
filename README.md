# WEEK 3 - ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS Challenge

To build an interactive game on the web.

## Getting Started

I finished this challenge and also did the bonus of two player. I have organised all files into their respective folders.

### Prerequisites

You should be able to run it via the config.ru file with rackup. Alternatively you can run it via the app.rb

## Running the tests

I have separated the tests into the feature and unit test folders. Rspec will run them all and they are passing with full coverage.

### REFLECTION

After initially taking time to figure out my approach to this, I found it to be a very useful challenge in getting a better understanding of the various facets of using the web in development. I am now more comfortable with Sinatra, Capybara and using modules.


### WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE

I got everything to work and the program is fairly robust. I would have preferred to have done the selection mechanism with simple clicks as opposed to typing in choices. However I was unable to implement that functionality.

Though I was very happy with the finished product, if I had more time...

```
1. Clicks to select choice instead of text.
```
