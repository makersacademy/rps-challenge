# RPS Challenge

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

The functionality so far:
- user can enter their name
- they are being redirected to the next page where they can see the choices
- there is a Person class to input the choices
- there is a Computer class that chooses randomly
- there is a Ruby program that compares the choices and checks who is the winner

Things are not working:
- at user choice we face an error (wrong number of argument error) hence not possible to compare with computer choices
- no enough tests yet

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
