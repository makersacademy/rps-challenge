# RPS Challenge

Task 
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

Approach
--------

* I wanted to create a 2 player game with similar experience to 2 player game on an Ipad where you have 1 player on 1 end and 1 player on the other end. This explains the layout I was going for.

* The idea is that player 1 will always go first and you can play until you exit the game by clicking "STOP PLAYING" button.

Instruction
-----------

* If you're unaware of the rule of a "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard" game please refer to this link (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_)
