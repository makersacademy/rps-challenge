# RPS Challenge

Week three weekend challenge at Makers Academy. My task is to test drive, using RSpec, the creation of a set of classes/modules to satisfy all the user stories below. In addition, I will use the Sinatra web application framework to convert my ruby code to a web application. Capybara will be used to feature test the application. 

Task
----

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

### Basic rules of the game:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

### Functionality I plan to implement:

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

### Bonus level: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other.

### Technologies Used:

1. Ruby
2. RSpec
3. Sinatra
4. Capybara
5. HTML and CSS
3. Github
