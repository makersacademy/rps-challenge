_Rock, Paper, Scissors_

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

The marketeer can enter their name before the game, and is then presented with the choices (rock, paper and scissors), of which they can select one option. The computer chooses a random option, and then the player find out if they have won/ lost or drawn.
