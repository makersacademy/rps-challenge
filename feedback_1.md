# birthday app- feedback guidelines.

## my goals for this app

I write code that is easy to change

I know how to TDD/ I can TDD anything


## specific questions 
testing
unit tests:
- do i need further tests for the Player class? (its currently just has initialize method)

feature tests:
- is it abit too simple? (for the game_spec.rb), I could not get computer to force choose one option so that it returns a specific result at result page.
