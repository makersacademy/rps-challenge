        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>It would be kind of weird if you'd made it this far into your life as a marketeer without knowing how to play rock paper scissors... Nothing on that? Okay, the rules are simple. Type your name in down there on the bottom right, click go, and then click on your weapon of choice. You'll be playing against the computer and it's best out of three (draws don't count as a round). Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. Have fun!</p>
