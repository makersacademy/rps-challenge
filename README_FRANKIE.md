## Challenge not complete: 

- Need to work on result page so when player clicks rock, the computer plays a move also.
- Will complete by Wednesday 22 May 2019. 

## To play the game: 

- Fork/clone this project
- In the terminal, run bundle to install all the dev dependencies
- In the terminal, type rackup to start the server (served on localhost:9292)
- Load up http://localhost:9292/ in your browser

## Approach: 

I seperated the programme into three classes: 
- Game
- Player
- Computer

My task was to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for marketers so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared



## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
