Initial ideas(npo):

 - Computer will pick random move from RNG. Easy enough to implement.
 - Need some nice buttons for the user to click.
 - Follow structure of cat exercise and Battle for general outline of MVC structure.
 - Maybe don't worry too much about making it look nice. Functionality first, then worry about the styling much, much later.
 - Test drive it. If you can't test drive it, don't spike it. Accept that that's as far as you get with this particular challenge.
 - Maybe keep score for fun?
