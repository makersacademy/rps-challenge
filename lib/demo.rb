# Rock, Paper, Scissors logic/ steps (UI)

# >> Player 1 enter name and gets name stored
# >> Player 1 can select Rock, Paper or Scissors
  # >> Start with one game e.g. one round and winner, moves to best of 3 e.g. game counter
# >> Computer selects Rock, Paper or Scissors (same time)
#   >> if selection == selection >> go again
#   >> if scisscors vs paper >> P1 win
#   >> elsif scissors vs rock >> CPU win

    # >> if rock vs scissors >> P1 win
    # >> elsif rock vs paper >> CPU win
    # >> if paper vs rock >> P1 win
    # >> if paper vs scissors >> CPU win
