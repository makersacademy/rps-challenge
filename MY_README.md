Rock Paper Scissors Challenge, by Daryl Watson
=======================

## Synopsis

This is my submission for the Rock Paper Scissors challenge. It is a one player game against the computer, where you can play the original game, or the extended Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock version. It is fully TTD with RSpec, Capybara and Cucumber.

I wanted to be able to have full coverage with Cucumber, but I was unable to stub the computer's random behaviour. I managed to do this on the unit tests with RSpec however.

## Technologies Used

- Ruby
- HTML
- Sinatra
- RSpec, Capybara, Cucumber
